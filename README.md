# Dear reader

In this paper I decompose the literature body of the Economic Complexity paradigm using text mining tools. The data used is a set of 1057 abstracts extracted from the publically available sources, I describe the selection criteria of the data, the preprocessing phase, the modeling and testing. Eventually I provide a an oiverall interpretation of the results with the necessary nuance with such an approach. The modeling phase resulted in 4 topics that encapsulates the 4 major elements of the literature, although with this same approach using full papers instead and a better refinment of the selection criteria of the corpora can yield much more detailed and insightful results.

This project is merely a trial as part of the requirements for my text mining class. 

feedback is welcomed.
