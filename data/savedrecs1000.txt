J	Hidalgo, CA				Hidalgo, Cesar A.			The policy implications of economic complexity	RESEARCH POLICY												In recent years economic complexity has grown into an active field of fundamental and applied research. Yet, despite important advances, the policy implications of economic complexity can remain unclear or misunderstood. Here I organize the policy implications of economic complexity in a framework grounded on 4 Ws: what approaches, focused on identifying target activities and/or locations; when approaches, focused on the timing of related and unrelated diversification; where approaches, focused on the geographic diffusion of knowledge; and who approaches, focused on the role played by agents of structural change. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework that groups, organizes, and clarifies the policy implications of economic complexity and facilitates its continued use in regional and international development.

J	Zhang, W; He, CF				Zhang, Wei; He, Canfei			Perilous Evolutionary Paths of Industrial Policy in a Developmental Context: Evidence from the Chinese Medical Industry	TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE												Industrial policy, as one of the most potent weapons employed by governments, is recommended to adhere to the principles of high relatedness and high economic complexity, which can minimize risks and maximize returns. However, this approach may not be optimal in developing countries with poor industrial bases, limited innovative capabilities and weak institutional frameworks. Based on relatedness and economic complexity, this study illustrates the evolution paths of industrial policy in China and identifies underlying influencing factors deciding the patterns of policymaking. Different from developed countries, it takes several steps for developing countries to reach the final target, the smart specialization approach, instead of one-step jumping. Moreover, industrial policy is not always the panacea, and the effects of industrial policy vary depending on local contexts. In sum, this study extends research towards the complex co-evolution process of policy and industries in developing countries and provides more insights for policymaking.

The time and frequency of unrelated diversification	RESEARCH POLICY												Economic diversification-the process by which locations enter new economic activities-is known to be a combination of related and unrelated diversification. Related diversification is-on average-more frequent, but unrelated diversification is nevertheless considered important to avoid economic lock-in. Here, we study the frequency and timing of unrelated diversification using two international trade datasets at the country level. We find that related diversification is more frequent for countries at low levels of development but becomes less frequent as countries climb the complexity ladder. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of relatedness in the diversification of economies at different levels of complexity.

J	Tacchella, A; Zaccaria, A; Miccheli, M; Pietronero, L				Tacchella, Andrea; Zaccaria, Andrea; Miccheli, Marco; Pietronero, Luciano			Relatedness in the era of machine learning	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS												Relatedness is a quantification of how much two human activities are similar in terms of the inputs and contexts needed for their development. Under the idea that it is easier to move between related activities than towards unrelated ones, empirical approaches to quantify relatedness are currently used as predictive tools to inform policies and development strategies in governments, international organizations, and firms. Here we show that the standard, widespread approach of estimating Relatedness through the co-location of activities (e.g. Product Space) generates a measure of relatedness that performs worse than trivial auto -correlation prediction strategies. In this paper, working on data about countries' trade, technologies, and scientific production, we show two main findings. First, we find that a shift from two-product correlations (network-density based) to many-product correlations (decision trees) can dramatically improve the quality of forecasts, allowing the possibility to assist policymakers in optimizing decisions to promote growth. Then, we propose a new methodology to empirically estimate Relatedness that we call Continuous Projection Space (CPS). CPS, which represents a general network embedding technique, vastly outperforms all the co-location, network-based approaches, while retaining similar interpretability in terms of pairwise distances. Depending on the dataset the best approach is always either CPS or machine learning algorithms based on decision trees.					zaccaria, andrea/F-8476-2018														0960-0779	1873-2887				NOV	2023	176								114071	10.1016/j.chaos.2023.114071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2023.114071		OCT 2023											WOS:001097549200001

Bilateral relatedness: knowledge diffusion and the evolution of bilateral trade	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS												During the last two decades, two important contributions have reshaped our understanding of international trade. First, countries trade more with those with whom they share history, language, and culture, suggesting that trade is limited by information frictions. Second, countries are more likely to start exporting products that are related to their current exports, suggesting that shared capabilities and knowledge diffusion constrain export diversification. Here, we join both of these streams of literature by developing three measures of bilateral relatedness and using them to ask whether the destinations to which a country will increase its exports of a product are predicted by these forms of relatedness. The first form is product relatedness, and asks whether a country already exports many similar products to a destination. The second is importer relatedness, and asks whether the country exports the same product to the neighbors of the target destination. The third is exporter relatedness, and asks whether a country's neighbors are already exporting the same product to the destination. We use bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2015, and a variety of controls in multiple gravity specifications, to show that countries are more likely to increase their exports of a product to a destination when they have more product relatedness, importer relatedness, and exporter relatedness. Then, we use several sample splits to explore whether the effects of these forms of relatedness are stronger for products of higher complexity, technological sophistication, and differentiation. We find that, in the case of product relatedness, the effects are stronger for differentiated, complex, and technologically sophisticated products. Also, we find the effects of common language and shared colonial past to increase with differentiation, complexity, and technological sophistication, while the effects of shared borders decrease with these three variables. These results suggest that product relatedness and common language capture dimensions of knowledge relatedness that are more important for the exchange of more sophisticated and differentiated products. These findings extend the ideas of relatedness to bilateral trade and show that the evolution of bilateral trade networks are shaped by relatedness among products, exporters, and importers.

J	Boschma, R				Boschma, Ron			An evolutionary approach to regional studies on global value chains	REGIONAL STUDIES												There is an ongoing dialogue that explores how the global production network and evolutionary economic geography (EEG) literatures can make promising crossovers. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by outlining a theoretical-analytical approach to regional studies on global value chains (GVCs). Building on the EEG literature on relatedness, economic complexity and regional diversification, this approach aims to develop a better understanding of the ability of regions to develop new and upgrade existing GVCs, and why regions may experience the loss or downgrading of existing GVCs. We present the features of this relatedness/complexity approach to GVCs and discuss potential fields of applications.																			0034-3404	1360-0591				2024 APR 4	2024										10.1080/00343404.2024.2323035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2024.2323035		APR 2024											WOS:001195568900001
J	Mealy, P; Coyle, D				Mealy, Penny; Coyle, Diane			To them that hath: economic complexity and local industrial strategy in the UK	INTERNATIONAL TAX AND PUBLIC FINANCE												Divergent economic performance in many countries has led to renewed interest in place-based policies, such as the UK's local industrial strategies at the level of Combined Authorities or Local Economic Partnerships. However, an analysis of employment data using methods from the economic complexity literature demonstrates great heterogeneity in industrial strengths and future growth opportunities within those jurisdictions, raising challenges in designing common policies suited to all sub-geographies. Moreover, the 'related' industries into which low-complexity, low-wage local authorities could potentially diversify are also low-wage. Incremental policies building on existing local capacities are therefore likely to amplify divergence between prospering and left-behind areas.

This paper explicitly accounts for regional capabilities as workforce skills to build skill relatedness and skill complexity measures, that is, the skill-spaces, for 107 Italian regions for the period 2013-19. The data-driven techniques we use reveal that skill-spaces form two highly polarised clusters into social-cognitive and technical-physical skills. We find evidence that social-cognitive skills yield the highest probabilities of regional competitive advantage. A comparison with co-location-based measures shows that our measures are able to capture a substantial part of regional capabilities that cannot be measured with previous measures.

Unpacking the nexus between the industrial structure and startup typologies	SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS												Plain English SummaryIn this paper, we question the implicit assumption that more entrepreneurship drives more innovation and growth, arguing that only specific typologies of entrepreneurship are responsible for these phenomena. In recent years, researchers have highlighted the importance of the factors external to the startups to explain the entrepreneurial dynamics. In particular, specialized and sophisticated economic systems have often been associated with a high level of entrepreneurship. Accordingly, we investigated the differentiated effects that industrial systems have on the high-potential typology of startups, namely, innovative startups, high-growth startups, and pioneers. Upon analyzing the case of Italy across a 5-year period (2015-2019), we found that certain compositions of industrial structure may either favor or hinder the typologies of the aforementioned startups. These results inform potential entrepreneurs of the importance to analyze how external conditions can distinctively affect the process of opportunity identification among different forms of high-potential startups. In this paper, we question the implicit assumption that more entrepreneurship drives more innovation and growth, asserting that specific typologies of entrepreneurship are responsible for these phenomena. A growing number of studies has analyzed this relationship while focusing on the overall level of entrepreneurship. This paper exploits recent advancements in measuring the sophistication and connectedness of economic systems, brought by the notions of economic complexity and relatedness, to study the nexus of industrial structure and high-potential forms of entrepreneurship. The present study uses a panel dataset for Italy for the period 2015-2019. The results show a differentiated pattern among the high-potential startups considered, with relatedness and complexity having a positive effect for innovative startups, a negative one for high-growth startups, and no effect for pioneers. These results inform potential entrepreneurs of the importance of analyzing how external conditions can have distinctive effects on the process of opportunity identification among different typologies of high-potential startups.

J	van Dam, A; Frenken, K				van Dam, Alje; Frenken, Koen			Variety, complexity and economic development	RESEARCH POLICY												We propose a combinatorial model of economic development. An economy develops by acquiring new capabilities allowing for the production of an ever greater variety of products with an increasing complexity. Taking into account that economies abandon the least complex products as they develop over time, we show that variety first increases and then decreases in the course of economic development. This is consistent with the empirical pattern known as 'the hump'. Our results question the common association of variety with complexity. We further discuss the implications of our model for future research.

Unpacking industries' relatedness	REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS												This study elaborates on a methodology that combines industry-level data (exports, HS 4-digits) with country-level indicators to determine which social capabilities are important when explaining patterns of comparative advantage (or structural transformation). The indicators used to characterize these capabilities are associated with different dimensions: economic, institutional, and cultural. Through the product space, we estimate a density measure identifying the proximity between non-competitive products and a country's current export profile, and then unpack the contribution of different relatedness channels to changes in comparative advantage by redefining densities in terms of social affinities between industries. We find that (i) countries can be competitive in certain industries, even if some of these capabilities are not high; (ii) all dimensions, but not all their components, matter in predicting changes in countries' comparative advantages; (iii) structural transformations take some time to materialize; and (iv) the inclusion of social affinities diminishes the influence of a density variable measuring overall relatedness to predict product takeoff.

The role of immigrants, emigrants and locals in the historical formation of European knowledge agglomerations	REGIONAL STUDIES												Did migrants make Paris a mecca for the arts and Vienna a beacon of classical music? Or was their rise a pure consequence of local actors? We use data on more than 22,000 historical individuals born between the years 1000 and 2000 to estimate the contribution of famous immigrants, emigrants and locals to the knowledge specialisations of European regions. We find that the probability that a region develops or keeps specialisation in an activity (based on the birth of famous physicists, painters, etc.) grows with both the presence of immigrants with knowledge about that activity and immigrants with knowledge in related activities. In contrast, we do not find robust evidence that the presence of locals with related knowledge explains entries and/or exits. We address some endogeneity concerns using fixed-effects models considering any location-period-activity-specific factors (e.g., the presence of a new university attracting scientists).

Therefore, a key issue for cities around the world is to develop new specialisations into more complex industries. In China, local governments tend to use urban land allocation as a tool to attract new firms from specific industries and promote industrial growth. However, relatively little is known about how this policy tool is related to the economic complexity of Chinese cities. Drawing upon the recent literature on the principle of relatedness and economic complexity, this paper investigates the relationship between industrial land policy (ILP) and the diversification of Chinese cities into more complex industries. The empirical results support our hypothesis that cities providing higher intensity of land subsidy are more likely to enter new industries and the more complex ones in particular.					li, yingcheng/ADI-7189-2022	li, yingcheng/0000-0002-0894-6461; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre/0000-0003-2787-4376													1366-2716	1469-8390				MAR 16	2022	29	3					367	395		10.1080/13662716.2021.1990022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13662716.2021.1990022		OCT 2021											WOS:000711317700001

By using linked employer-employee data for Norway (years 2013-2017), we address two research questions: whether some parts of the economy increasingly need people who are "specialised" in ICT, in the sense that the main focus of their formal education is ICT, and whether the ongoing digitisation processes in the Norwegian economy have altered the complementarities between ICT education and other types of formal education. By means of a shift-share analysis, we disentangle the contributions to employment deriving from variation in the education mix within the sectors. We also observe the recent labour flows of ICT-educated workers across sectors of the Norwegian economy. Then, an establishment-level analysis sheds light on possible evolutions of the complementarity of ICT education with other types of education. Public administration and health are revealed to be increasingly important attractors for ICT-educated people. Nonetheless, the ICT industries still employ many ICT-educated individuals and they are becoming more specialised, possibly as outsourcees of services to other industries. Finally, flows of ICT-educated employees from and to the sales sector and the publishing and audiovisual industries suggest an evolving knowledge content in these areas of the economy.

However, the high number of parameters involved prevents a straightforward interpretation of the results and, in turn, the explainability of policy indications. In this paper, we propose a procedure to statistically validate the importance of the products used in the feasibility assessment. In this way, we are able to identify which products, called explainers, significantly increase the probability to export a target product in the near future.

Specifically, we analyze the evolution of the productive capabilities from 1999 to 2014 in the five less developed southern states where the federal government wants to generate development poles. Using the economic complexity methodology and estimating the network of relatedness, our findings indicate that these states have been specialized in non-complex capabilities, and that states specialized in capabilities with greater betweenness centrality tend to have greater diversification. Finally, we identify the manufacturing capabilities with the greatest potential to trigger structural change.

We selected companies that sold to the Ministry of Defense (MD) between 2001 and 2019 from the Brazilian Federal Government's public procurement database (ComprasNet). These companies were chosen based on their sectoral relevance according to relevant theoretical works. Our contribution lies in using economic activity co-occurrence reported by companies, using microdata in an unprecedented exercise in the field of defense studies. The main findings show that dominant sectors with higher technological intensity tend to have a closer relationship and greater diversity of relationships within the DIB compared to other sectors. By defining sectors with high potential for technological interaction based on relevant characteristics such as centrality, technological intensity, and MD budget share, we were able to identify the existence of sectoral clusters that can generate greater productive and technological spillovers, with particular emphasis on aircraft manufacture and ICT-related industrial sectors.

J	Bucher, F; Scheu, L; Schröpf, B				Bucher, Florian; Scheu, Lucas; Schroepf, Benedikt			Economic complexity and environmental pollution: evidence from the former socialist transition countries	EMPIRICA												This study examines the link between economic complexity and environmental pollution by exploiting a massive and unprecedented decline of CO2 emissions and complexity in the former socialist transition countries after the fall of the iron curtain. We refer to the extended theories of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), stating that environmental pollution follows an inverted u-shaped course with respect to economic complexity. Using comprehensive data of 27 countries for the period 1995-2017, our results show that the EKC can be found for countries whose complexity rose over time. Additionally, since the results for production-based and consumption-based CO2 emissions are similar, we can discard emissions offshoring as a major explaining factor. Consequently, our findings suggest that more complex products have influenced the u-shaped course of the EKC. However, as the turning point is associated with high levels of pollution, our estimates imply that complexity may even exacerbate environmental issues in the short and middle run in less developed countries.

To address this question, we have conducted the first Systematic Mapping Study of the literature related to the economic complexity theory, employing databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and Semantic Scholar following the PRISMA statement complemented with a science mapping technique. Our endeavor has culminated in the compilation of 687 documents published between 2006 and 2022. The findings of this systematic review reveal a thematic and semantic network that interconnects economic complexity with the following dimensions of sustainability: (1) Economic, (2) Social and Human, (3) Environmental, (4) Political, and (5) Cultural. The results offer compelling evidence that research into economic complexity is actively striving to promote studies that are pertinent to the challenges articulated by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Furthermore, we propose five avenues for shaping a future research agenda based on the emerging research trends detected through in-depth analysis. In conclusion, we affirm that economic complexity stands as a robust theory that aids in comprehending the multidimensional challenges arising from the pursuit of sustainable development.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of individualism, one of the most significant dimensions of culture, on economic complexity. Individualistic societies stress the importance of freedom and of rewarding high achievers, which creates a conducive environment for the emergence of economic complexity. We conduct a cross-country analysis based on a global sample of 81 countries using an individualism score and an economic complexity index. Further, we establish a causal relationship by using the historical prevalence of infectious disease and a pronoun drop indicator as instruments for individualism. Our findings indicate that individualism has a strong, significant, and positive effect on economic complexity; and this relation is strengthened in countries with higher levels of innovation and democracy. These results are robust to the addition of various controls and sensitivity checks.																			0264-9993	1873-6122				OCT	2022	115								105961	10.1016/j.econmod.2022.105961	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2022.105961		AUG 2022											WOS:000863165600004

It explores regional diversification in an emerging economy, focusing on diversification opportunities of regions with distinct levels of local capabilities. We investigate the importance of relatedness and economic complexity for sectoral and technological diversification in all regions of Brazil during the period 2006-2019. Regions tend to diversify in sectors/technologies requiring similar capabilities to those already available locally. In general, the higher the sector/technology complexity, the lower the probability of diversification. However, in high-complex regions, complexity reverses into a positive force for diversification. Our analysis shows diversification prospects vary widely across different types of regions in Brazil.

How might countries reorient their existing industrial structures to be more competitive in an environmentally friendly world? To investigate these questions, this paper develops a novel methodology for measuring productive capabilities to the green economy. By constructing a new comprehensive dataset of traded green products and drawing on economic complexity methods, we rank countries in terms of their ability to export complex green products competitively. We show that higher ranked countries are more likely to have higher environmental patenting rates, lower CO2 emissions, and more stringent environmental policies even after controlling for per capita GDP. We then examine countries' potential to transition into green products in the future and find strong path dependence in the accumulation of green capabilities. Our results shed new light on green industrialisation and have a number of implications for green industrial policy.

J	Al Marhubi, F				Al Marhubi, Fahim			Economic Complexity and Inflation: An Empirical Analysis	ATLANTIC ECONOMIC JOURNAL												This study examines the relationship between inflation and economic complexity, the set of productive capabilities and know-how embedded in the structure of an economy. It posits that economic complexity, by providing the economy with the ability to reduce macroeconomic shocks, is associated with lower inflation. Economic complexity is inferred from the overall sophistication and mix of a country's exports. Complex economies are highly diversified and export a large number of less ubiquitous products. Using a sample of 94 countries for the period 1970 to 2014, the impact of economic complexity on inflation is estimated using the Arellano and Bond generalized method of moments estimation procedure. The empirical results show that economic complexity has a negative causal impact on inflation. This effect is statistically significant, quantitatively large, and robust. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest that development driven by economic diversification, a critical component of economic complexity, rather than export specialization, is more likely to promote low inflation, a crucial objective of macroeconomic policy.																			0197-4254	1573-9678				SEP	2021	49	3					259	271		10.1007/s11293-021-09727-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11293-021-09727-0		NOV 2021											WOS:000723499300001

JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION												This study assesses the effect of tax revenue on economic complexity in Africa using a sample of 29 African countries from 1995 to 2018. Applying the system generalized method of moments (GMM), we found that tax revenue spurs economic complexity in Africa by providing countries with critical financial resources to produce complex and sophisticated goods. We performed several robustness tests, including controlling for macroeconomic volatility and employing various measures of economic complexity and tax revenue, and the results remain robust. Furthermore, the mediation analysis results show that the effect of tax revenue on economic complexity is mediated by financial development and government spending. This study advocates for government strategies to enact tax reforms and maximize tax revenue mobilization, which will help finance economic complexity.

Situational modeling of trajectories of regions' economic complexity	EKONOMIKA I MATEMATICESKIE METODY-ECONOMICS AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS												An increase in the economic complexity of the region can contribute to an increase in the level of material well-being of the population. Therefore, the growth of the economic complexity of the structure of the regional economy should be considered as one of the criteria for evaluating solutions that contribute to diversification. An increase in the output of one sector in a region may lead to a change in the structure of strong sectors of its economy and the assessment of its economic complexity. It is important to take into account that the structures of strong sectors in other regions may change at the same time. The paper presents the conditions under which such changes happen. Using these results, a comparative analysis of the trajectories of assessments of the regions economic complexity based on two approaches was carried out: the choice of a sector or type of economic activity in the region for development to a strong level that ensures maximum growth of the region's economic complexity; the choice of a sector or type of economic activity that has the highest assessment of economic complexity. The trajectories of assessments of the regions economic complexity, constructed in two different ways, should be considered as alternatives for comparison with the trajectories obtained on the basis of expert choice of the direction of diversification. The results of regression analysis are presented, indicating the possibility of forecasting the index of the regions economic complexity by sectors using the index of the regions economic complexity by types of economic activity, the first and second main components of the structure of the economy by types of economic activity.																			0424-7388					OCT-DEC	2023	59	4					58	70		10.31857/S042473880028217-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S042473880028217-7													WOS:001156305200005

For this, we adopted a novel methodology to measure the productive capabilities of the green economy in Mexico, thereby discovering the green product space at a subnational scale. Economic complexity methods were used to estimate the Green Complexity Index (GCI) and the Green Complexity Potential (GCP) for 32 Mexican regions considering a time series from 2004 to 2018 and a set of data on international trade in ecological products. The main findings are reflected in a grid of the Green Adjacent Possible (GAP) and a heatmap that shows the "grasslands" (current green products by state). The results are likely to influence industrial policy and state innovation agendas. A limitation of this work is that it is based only on data from the formal, industrial, and regulated economy. The originality lies in the fact that there were no previous studies in the context analyzed, and the fecundity of the research reflects the need to expand the study with a focus on green business models.

We also analyze the factors that determine the economic complexity of these subnational entities. To do this we used different indices of economic complexity (linear and non-linear), as well as system generalized method of moments (GMM-SYS) estimators in dynamic panels to avoid endogeneity problems. The results showed that: i) through the descriptive analysis (both by the linear and the non-linear versions) a positive relationship between the UFs' economic complexity and economic growth was observed; ii) the econometric analysis showed that measures of economic complexity are positively related to economic growth however, some of the coefficients did not show statistical significance and the coefficients that represent the non-linear approach showed weak correlation; iii) there is a positive relationship between the real exchange rate at the state level (R$/US$) and the UFs' productive transformation, such as between the UFs' productive transformation and the economic complexity.

The analysed period characterises high globalisation in which "new" EU countries experienced a high transformation of their productive structure. Production structure largely determines income distribution and, thus, income inequality. We employed panel data methodology to assess the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality. To control for economic activity and education, GDP per capita and average years of secondary schooling are also included in the analysis. Expectedly, our findings point to the correlation between economic complexity and income inequality in EU countries. However, the results also indicate an opposite effect between the "old" EU member states and a group of "new" EU member states. This finding suggests that "new" EU members needed more economic complexity in the observed period to reduce income inequality.

In this study, we quantify the indirect or spillover effect of economic complexity on growth based on the following two facts: i) economic complexity is an important factor in explaining GDP growth rates, and ii) there is a clear regional pattern in the states' economic complexity, i.e., the economic complexity variable shows a positive spatial autocorrelation. Our results provide two insights: first, that the estimated positive spillover effect of complexity on growth is not negligible, particularly for states in the north of the country, whose own economic complexity is as important as that of their neighbors. In contrast, the spillover effect in southern states is negative. Being located next to states with low levels of economic complexity has a significant negative externality that almost overrides the positive effect of a state's own level of complexity. Our findings lead us to conclude that spillover effects may have played a more important role in explaining the diverse pattern of growth between northern and southern Mexico than previously thought.

The TRA could degrade into the classicaleconomic complexity index (ECI) when the tunable parameter equals zero. We apply the TRA dynamics to theperfectly nested triangular matrix and the real country-product bipartite network from the world trade data tointerpret economic complexity respectively. The parametric interpretations provide conceptual descriptions ofthe economic complexity index, shedding new light on a pattern of specialization of resource allocation, andthe fluctuation of the economic complexity in countries and products. Moreover, the relationship of economiccomplexity between countries and products in the framework of TRA reveals that higher-ECI countries usuallyspecialize in higher-ECI products while products not so as to countries, and the correlation strength varieswith tunable parameters.																			0960-0779	1873-2887				APR	2024	181								114660	10.1016/j.chaos.2024.114660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2024.114660		MAR 2024											WOS:001208949800001
J	Bahar, D; Rapoport, H; Turati, R				Bahar, Dany; Rapoport, Hillel; Turati, Riccardo			Birthplace diversity and economic complexity: Cross-country evidence	RESEARCH POLICY												We empirically investigate the relationship between a country's economic complexity and the diversity in the birthplaces of its immigrants. Our cross-country analysis suggests that countries with higher birthplace diversity by one standard deviation are more economically complex by 0.1 to 0.18 standard deviations above the mean. This holds particularly for diversity among highly educated migrants and for countries at intermediate levels of economic complexity. We address endogeneity concerns by instrumenting diversity through predicted stocks from a pseudo-gravity model as well as from a standard shift-share approach. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that birthplace diversity boosts economic complexity by increasing the diversification of the host country's export basket.

J	Ranjbar, O; Rassekh, F				Ranjbar, Omid; Rassekh, Farhad			Does economic complexity influence the efficacy of foreign direct investment? An empirical inquiry	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT												This paper aims to determine whether economic complexity influences the efficacy of inward foreign direct investment (FDI). To this end, in the context of a theoretical framework, we estimate a model that relates economic growth to the flow as well as the stock of FDI while taking into account the role of complexity of the economy (measured by the Economic Complexity Index). This index captures the capabilities that are embodied in the productive structure of the economy. Our empirical work shows that economic complexity influences the growth effect of FDI on the host countries. We find countries that rank relatively high in economic complexity benefit from FDI while countries that rank very low may be adversely affected.

J	Vu, TV				Vu, Trung V.			Does institutional quality foster economic complexity? The fundamental drivers of productive capabilities	EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS												This study investigates the role of institutions in shaping international differences in economic complexity-a novel measure of productive capabilities. More specifically, economic complexity corresponds to an enhanced capacity to produce and export a diverse range of sophisticated (high-productivity) products. This paper hypothesizes that there exists a positive association between institutional quality and economic complexity. The underlying intuition is that well-functioning institutions fundamentally drive structural transformation towards productive activities via strengthening incentives for innovative entrepreneurship, fostering human capital accumulation, and deploying human resources in acquiring productive capabilities. Employing data for up to 115 countries, I consistently obtain precise estimates of the positive effect of institutional quality, measured by the Economic Freedom of the World Index, on economic complexity. The main findings advocate for establishing a pro-development institutional environment, which helps attenuating the persistence of underdevelopment by fostering economic complexity.

J	Canh, NP; Thanh, SD				Canh, Nguyen Phuc; Thanh, Su Dinh			The Dynamics of Export Diversification, Economic Complexity and Economic Growth Cycles: Global Evidence	FOREIGN TRADE REVIEW												This article investigates the dynamics of export diversification, economic complexity and economic growth cycles. By applying several econometric techniques for estimating a panel data set of 70 economies over the period from 1996 to 2014, the results have been threefold. First, there is Granger bi-directional causality between economic complexity and export diversification, while unidirectional Granger causality exists from economic complexity to economic growth cycles. Second, the result attained from the three-stage least squares estimate demonstrates that economic complexity and export diversification significantly impact each other. Notably, the effect of economic complexity is found to be negative on economic growth cycles, implying that the dynamics of economic complexity and export diversification generate a reduction in economic fluctuations. Third, by splitting the sample into two subsamples (i.e., 32 high-income economies and 38 low- and middle-income economies) and two sub-periods (i.e., 1994-2007 and 2008-2014), the results show that the positive dynamics between economic complexity and export diversification are consistent with income levels and time periods. However, the negative impact of economic complexity on economic growth cycles is statistically significant only for the group of high-income economies and during the 1996-2007 period. These findings are checked by several estimators and different proxies of export diversification, economic growth cycles and economic complexity.

Empirical study of Iraq	CUADERNOS DE ECONOMIA-SPAIN												In recent years, the significance of economic complexity in raising a country's development level has been widely acknowledged. It is imperative for economies to enhance their level of product sophistication. The prevailing consensus posits that the pursuit of increased economic complexity is a fundamental strategy for achieving economic advancement. The imperative for all nations at present is to augment the degree of economic complexity. Several previous studies have conducted empirical analyses to estimate the factors that positively influence economic complexity. However, there is a lack of research studies that specifically examine the impact of financial development on economic complexity. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to empirically assess the relationship between financial development and economic complexity in Iraq during the period from 2000 to 2022. This study utilized Dynamic OLS (DOLS), Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), and Canonical Cointegration Regression (CCR) methodologies to examine the empirical implications of financial development and several control variables, such as income, foreign direct investment, urbanization, and natural resources, on economic complexity. The study's findings suggest that the development of the financial sector plays a positive role in enhancing the economic complexity of Iraq. Likewise, economic growth, foreign direct investment, and urbanisation make positive contributions to the enhancement of economic complexity. However, the impact of natural resources on economic complexity is predominantly negative. Hence, it is imperative for the Iraqi government to undertake policy measures aimed at the development and enhancement of its financial system, with the goal of bolstering its industrial structure and augmenting product sophistication.																			0210-0266	2340-6704				MAY-AUG	2023	46	131					135	144		10.32826/cude.v46i131.1114	http://dx.doi.org/10.32826/cude.v46i131.1114													WOS:001126671600005

Specifically, we investigate the effects of four aspects (employment, health, educa-tion, rights) of gender equality with 20 variables in an economic complexity index. To deal with potential endogeneity, we used the two-step system-generalized method of moments approach with an unbalanced panel of data on 119 economies from 1991 to 2017. First, labor participation in industry or service sectors as well as wage and salaried employment by women appears to improve economic complexity, while women's employment in agriculture, contributions to family workers, self-employment, and vulnerable employment have a negative impact. Second, better health conditions for women increase economic complexity. Third, gender equality in education has a positive impact on economic complexity. Fourth, the empowerment of women in terms of socioeconomic-political rights is a positive factor for economic complexity. Overall, gender equality has great benefits for economic complexity.

Our research explores the spatial mediating roles of energy structure and energy efficiency, considering both local and spillover effects. We find economic complexity has a positive local effect, but a negative spillover effect on carbon emissions. The positive local effect is more potent in countries with high economic complexity compared to low ones. Economic complexity promotes local carbon emissions by curbing local energy structure but limits the carbon emissions of neighbours by boosting their energy efficiency. This study enriches the relevant achievements of the mechanism by which economic complexity impacts carbon emissions. Governments should take advantage of the environmental benefits of economic complexity, focus on technological improvements and green production, optimize the energy mix and promote energy efficiency.

Effects of terrorism and economic policy uncertainty on economic complexity in Africa: A study of the moderating role of governance institutions	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS												Following the paucity of empirical evidence on the effects of terrorism and uncertainty on economic complexity in Africa and the moderating role of governance institutions on these relationships, this study raised two important questions. First, how are terrorism and uncertainty impacting on economic complexity in Africa? Second, how are governance institutions moderating the effects of terrorism and uncertainty on economic complexity in Africa? To answer these questions, the study employed pooled ordinary least squares and dynamic system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators, with a panel of 33 African countries over the period 2010-2021. We find that the unconditional effects of terrorism and uncertainty on economic complexity in Africa are predominantly negative and significant. We also find that governance institutions predominantly have unconditional positive and significant impact on economic complexity in Africa but failed to moderate the adverse effect of uncertainty on economic complexity. However, trade openness, international tourism and lagged economic complexity are potent factors promoting economic complexity in Africa, while physical capital stock remained a deterring factor. The study concluded that policymakers and leaders in Africa should engage in collaborative efforts at the African Union level to promote high-quality institutions, while simultaneously addressing the detrimental effects of terrorism and uncertainty on the continent.

The issue of the effectiveness of sanctions is increasingly being debated with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. While several empirical studies have questioned the effectiveness of international sanctions, especially with regard to their adverse effects on the well-being of populations, surprisingly little is known about the cross-country effect of sanctions on economic complexity. This study therefore investigates, as a first attempt, the effects of international sanctions on economic complexity in 76 target developing countries over the period 1998-2019. Our baseline model includes UE, US, and UN sanctions, and the empirical results show that international sanctions reduce economic complexity, with UE sanctions being more detrimental for target countries. These results are robust when considering alternative measures of international sanctions (including unilateral, plurilateral, economic, non-economic, financial, travel, trade, military, arms, and intensity of sanctions), alternative measures of economic complexity, and the instrumentation with the share of important votes in the UN General Assembly. Furthermore, we also test for potential channels and show that human capital, foreign investment, institutional quality, and terrorism are mechanisms through which international sanctions could affect economic complexity.

The link between the ecological footprint and economic complexity is explored within a panel of 48 complex economies over the period 1995-2014. The panel analysis is based on the annual data series of the economic complexity index (ECI), fossil fuel energy consumption, income per capita, and the ecological footprint of production. The econometrical analysis, based on second-generation unit root tests, cointegration testing, and estimation of fully modified ordinary square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) models in a heterogeneous panel of countries, revealed a validated positive long-run association between the ecological footprint of production as dependent variable and the economic complexity index, gross domestic product per capita, and fossil fuel energy consumption. The paper sheds light on the critical situation of environmental sustainability, taking into consideration that 75% of countries under examination are in ecological deficit.

The results illustrate a clear positive association between EC and fertility change across Italian provinces for the period considered, net of traditional fertility predictors.

Correlation between economic complexity and economic development in different types of Russian regions	ZHURNAL NOVAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA-JOURNAL OF THE NEW ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION												Economic complexity, according to the results of various studies at the country level, can be used as an indicator of economic development: more developed countries usually have a higher level of economic complexity. For Russian regions, the relationship between economic complexity, the level of innovative development and investment attractiveness is also revealed. This paper identifies the correlation between the complexity of export and the level of economic development for Russian regions and their separated more homogeneous groups. The results obtained by the author for regions of Russia contradict the rule identified for countries. For all Russian regions, there is a slight inverse correlation between the complexity of export and the value of per capita GRP. A slight positive correlation was found only for regions with a low export-to-GRP ratio and a high level of economic complexity. Such results are explained by the simple structure of Russian export, because of this the main recipients of export income are regions with a lower level of economic complexity - mainly oil and gas producing regions, as well as capitals that act as intermediaries.

We utilise the pool mean group (PMG) framework to analyse the panel series. Empirical result reveals that natural resources positively but insignificantly impact short- and long-run growth. For economic complexity, it exerts a significantly negative effect on growth in the short term but has a long-term favourable effect that is significant on growth. More so, the conditional impact of economic complexity and resource rent on economic growth is positive in both short- and long-run but only significant in the long run. Lastly, the study employs the economic complexity index plus to confirm the robustness of the empirical results. We therefore conclude that economic complexity is an important channel for promoting long-term resource blessing in Africa. The study then makes policies to improve the resource-growth link via the economic complexity channel.

In the case of Mexico, previous studies have documented the role of diverse characteristics in attracting FDI to the country's states. This study shows that economic complexity - a variable that indicates the productive capabilities or productive knowledge that exist in a given economy's economic structure - can explain the distribution of FDI among Mexican states. Similar to previous studies, we document the spillover effects of economic complexity, i.e., we show how states surrounded by states with a high level of economic complexity tend to receive more FDI. Moreover, we document how FDI flows to manufacturing industries are positively correlated with their level of economic complexity. This result, to the best of our knowledge, has not been documented before in this literature.

Specifically, we used HS 6-digit detailed trade data for 197 countries over the period from 2000-2017. The results show that the economic complexity of most ASEAN countries, except for Cambodia, Laos, and Indonesia, has improved. The export baskets of ASEAN countries are shifting from low complexity products to medium and high complexity products. We also evaluate the export quality of countries using weighted product complexity, which shows that the export quality of ASEAN countries has improved. The regression results show that economic complexity has positive effects on economic growth, and they also show that infrastructure, education level, trade openness, and financial openness contribute to the development of countries. However, the impact extent of economic complexity varies among different ASEAN countries; for example, its impact is weaker in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia but stronger in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines.

However, empirical studies that uncover the nexus between demographic dividend and economic complexity are lacking. This study examines how demographic dividend contributes economic complexity in 27 African countries for the period 1996-2017. Using Driscoll-Kraay standard errors and IV-GMM to address cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity issues, the empirical results show that demographic dividend contributes positively to economic complexity. The results also show that resource rents and internal conflict are negatively associated with economic complexity, whilst human capital and ICT enhance it. Lastly, the findings indicated that FDI, human capital, and ICT are channels through which demographic dividend affects economic complexity. Policies which can help maximise the benefits of the demographic dividend to promote economic complexity are suggested.																			1868-7865	1868-7873				2024 APR 2	2024										10.1007/s13132-024-01908-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13132-024-01908-x		APR 2024											WOS:001195649600001
J	Shahabadi, A; Pouran, R				Shahabadi, Abolfazl; Pouran, Roghayeh			Exploring the Interaction of Population, Globalization, and Institutional Factors for Achieving Economic Complexity in D8 Countries	JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY												Population plays a direct role in the production and demand of goods and services. Moreover, through indirect channels, the skilled and educated population, represented as the human capital as well as the process of research and development, innovation, and foreign direct investment, it can generate some complex and diverse products and, thus, would lead to creating the economic complexity of countries. Ultimately, all of these mechanisms can be employed under the appropriate institutional environment. Thus, the goal of this study is to explore the interaction of population, globalization, and institutional factors in achieving economic complexity. For this purpose, the population is divided into two categories: a population that is ready to work and produce, active population (between 15 and 64 years), and others (less than 14 years and over 65). The results of estimating the panel model by fully modified OLS (FMOLS) method during 1995-2019 show that the inactive population has a positive effect on the economic complexity in D8 countries. This means that this category of population is considered as a remarkable market for complex products. Furthermore, the interaction of active population, globalization, and institutional variables on the economic complexity of the studied countries is positive. This paper suggests that if the potential capacities of globalization and targeted guidance of the productive population are used, in the shadow of improving the institutional quality, we can see the positive effect of the productive population on the economic complexity of countries.					pouran, roghayeh/JFJ-5260-2023	pouran, roghayeh/0000-0001-8307-4643													1868-7865	1868-7873				2023 JUN 7	2023										10.1007/s13132-023-01223-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13132-023-01223-x		JUN 2023											WOS:001004162700004

The results show that economic complexity is statistically related to inequality; that is, states with more diversified and sophisticated economic structures (more complex economies) tend to have fairer income distribution. Furthermore, there is some evidence of a local spatial spillover effect of economic complexity; in short, a states level of income inequality is not only related to its own level of economic complexity but also its neighbours' level. Employing panel methods, our estimations use control variables that other similar studies have considered important, such as gross domestic product, population, education, corruption control, government effectiveness, voice and accountability, and rule of law.

Analyses are carried out for 115 economies and three subsamples (i.e., 45 low- and lower-middle-income economies (LMEs); 32 upper-middle-income economies (UMEs); and 38 high-income economies (HIES)) from 1995 to 2017. Several estimates are applied to panel data, providing robust results. First, increases in economic complexity are found to (i) reduce the relative size of the shadow economy (% official GDP); while (ii) increasing the absolute size of the shadow economy (constant USD). This implies that economic complexity might have benefits for both the official and shadow economies, but the benefits for the official economy are likely dominant over the shadow economy. Second, economic complexity appears to have a negative influence on both the relative and absolute size of the shadow economy in the long run. Third, the analyses for the three subsamples add further findings. The influence of economic complexity on the shadow economy is found to be consistent in HIES and LMEs, while economic complexity has a negative influence on both the relative and absolute size of the shadow economy in UMEs.

Spillovers across industries and regions in China's regional economic diversification	REGIONAL STUDIES												Industrial diversification depends on spillovers from related industries and nearby regions, yet their interaction remains largely unclear. We study economic diversification in China during the period 1990-2015 and present supportive evidence on both spillover channels. We add to the literature by showing that these two channels behave as substitutes when explaining new entries and exits, and by using acceleration campaigns of high-speed rail to address some endogeneity concerns with regional spillovers.

Our results suggest that a group of countries in the EU whose economic complexity exceeds a certain threshold tend to converge to levels of income corresponding to their measured complexity. On the other hand, the interaction of the current account deficit with economic complexity has important effects on growth for a second group of countries with lower levels of complexity. Since we also find that income convergence is faster within the first group, we argue that convergence is much faster for countries whose economic complexity exceeds a certain threshold.					binatli, ayla ogus/AAD-1794-2019; binatli, ayla ogus/A-2699-2013	binatli, ayla ogus/0000-0002-8291-0010; 													0012-8775	1557-9298				MAR-APR	2016	54	2					93	108		10.1080/00128775.2015.1126787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00128775.2015.1126787													WOS:000373158300002

It is often assumed that relatedness is a source of synergies. Our study distinguishes between business, cultural, technological, and size relatedness. It discusses the reasons why these different forms of relatedness can lead to an acquisition success and we conduct a meta-analysis of 67 prior M&A studies. Results indicate that positive effects can be expected under specific conditions only and have a limited overall impact on acquisition success.

Examining the relationship between sustainable development and this new tool is vital in determining new policies. By applying panel data of OECD countries covering different development levels from 1996 to 2017 to a data-driven dynamic econometric model, the research provides fresh insight between sustainable development and economic complexity. The results indicate that economic complexity is significantly affected by sustainable developments' economic indicators such as GDP, FDI, R&D expenditure, social indicators such as human development, income inequality, and environmental indicators such as productionbased CO2 emissions, renewable energy consumption, and greenhouse gas. The research, consequently, suggests that switching to technology and knowledge-based production processes, expanding qualified production factor capacity, raising social living standards, and making investments in the green economy will foster economic complexity while ensuring stable sustainability.

We employ a unique and recently developed measure of pandemic intensity, which is the World Pandemic Discussion Index. Using panel-corrected standard error regressions on a panel dataset of 90 countries from 1996 to 2019, we find that an increase in pandemic discussion could reduce economic complexity. Further heterogeneity tests show that this detrimental effect of pandemics only occurs in emerging and low-income countries, or in countries with low levels of institutional quality. By using mechanism analysis, we also find that pandemics reduce economic complexity via deteriorating the quality of human capital. These findings are robust to a comprehensive battery of robustness and sensitivity checks. Overall, our paper could provide valuable implications for policy makers in devising measures to support the economic recovery process post-pandemics.

J	Guneri, B; Yalta, AY				Guneri, Barbaros; Yalta, A. Yasemin			Does economic complexity reduce output volatility in developing countries?	BULLETIN OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH												Economic complexity measures the productive knowledge embedded in an economy by analysing the export structure of countries. Although the recent literature suggests that economic complexity might arise as a useful tool to lower output volatility by both diversifying export bundles and increasing the sophistication of exports, the empirical evidence on this issue is rather scarce. We contribute to the existing literature by investigating the effect of economic complexity on output volatility for a large set of developing countries. To this end, we apply a panel vector auto regression (PVAR) methodology, which allows us to capture the dynamic interrelationships between variables. The findings of the paper robust to the alternative specifications reveal that economic complexity affects output volatility negatively. Hence, economic policies aimed at diversifying productive capabilities and export bundles should be one of the major priorities in developing countries.

The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) measures the multiplicity of knowledge embedded in an economy's productive structure and can be interpreted as an indicator of "qualified diversity". We assess the impact of ECI on the distribution dynamics of labor productivity by combining growth regression analysis with conditional density estimates. Counterfactual analysis results suggest that ECI plays a key role in the observed tendency to polarization of regional labor productivity. We also provide evidence of a long-run relationship between labor productivity and ECI by using a panel cointegration analysis.

Effects of public infrastructural development and industrialization on economic complexity in Africa: Emerging insight from panel data analysis	AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT												This study examined the effects of public infrastructural development and industrialization on economic complexity in Africa, and how industrialization is moderating the effect of public infrastructural development on economic complexity. The study adopted the pooled ordinary least squares, the dynamic system generalized method of moments and the dynamic bias-corrected least squares dummy variable estimators with a panel of 34 African economies over the period 2010-2021. The findings revealed that public infrastructural development and industrialization contribute positively and significantly toward enhancing economic complexity in Africa. We also found that industrialization substantially moderates and enhances the influence of public infrastructural development on economic complexity. Furthermore, the results show that trade openness, foreign direct investment inflow, international tourism arrival and institutional quality are potent factors enhancing Africa's economic complexity, while the role of human capital remains muted. These findings suggest that African leaders and policy-makers can foster economic complexity across the continent by embracing policies that prioritize increased infrastructural development, industrialization, trade openness and foreign direct investment inflow while improving the quality of institutions within the region.

Testing 53 economies over the period 2006-2016, we find a significant Granger causality from economic complexity to entrepreneurship density, but reverse causality is not supported. Also, we suggest that entrepreneurship density is an inverted-U shaped function of economic complexity. That is, an increase in economic complexity initially facilitates entrepreneurship density as more business opportunities are created. However, beyond a specific threshold, an increase in economic complexity induces higher risks and uncertainties, discouraging entrepreneurial activities. The results remain robust by different estimators and in sub-samples of High-Income Economies and Low-and-Middle-Income Economies.

J	You, WH; Zhang, Y; Lee, CC				You, Wanhai; Zhang, Yue; Lee, Chien-Chiang			The dynamic impact of economic growth and economic complexity on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: An advanced panel data estimation	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY												The goal of this study is to explore the causal relationship among economic growth, economic complexity and CO2 emissions by using panel data of 95 countries for the period 1996-2015. A novel panel Granger approach proposed by Juodis et al. (2021) is adopted. Under this approach, we can explore the Granger causality in homogeneous or heterogeneous panels. To uncover the heterogeneous causal effects at different income levels, this study further divide the sample into three groups according to their annual income levels. Empirical results show that there are bi-directional causalities among economic growth, economic complexity and CO2 emissions for all groups. However, the magnitudes of the effects are heterogeneous for different groups. As to low-income countries, economic complexity is positive and significant for CO2 emissions, while CO2 emissions are negative for economic complexity. Furthermore, there is a positive interaction between economic complexity and C(O)2 emissions for middle-income countries. Regarding high-income countries, however, increasing economic complexity might effectively reduce CO2 emissions, and CO2 emissions can significantly increase economic complexity. Additionally, economic complexity will prominently decrease GDP in low-income countries. These findings are robust to different economic complexity indexes. Our results suggest that both developing and developed countries should set a reasonable CO2 emissions target, and on this basis, maintain a good balance between economic complexity and CO2 emissions.

We show that moving to higher levels of economic sophistication of exported goods leads to less unemployment and more employment, revealing that economic complexity does not induce job loss. Our findings remain robust across alternative econometric specifications. Furthermore, we place the spotlight on the link between products' embodied knowledge (sophistication) and labour market outcomes at the micro-level. We build a product-level index that attaches a product to the average level of unemployment (or employment) in the countries that export it. With this index, we illustrate how the development of sophisticated products is associated with changes in the labour market and show that the economic sophistication of exported goods captures information about the economy's job creation and destruction.

However, the GRP trajectory is not necessarily interconnected with the trajectory of its technical efficiency. The hypothesis is tested that for groups of regions with a close structure of strong sectors, with fairly high group estimates of economic complexity and group estimates of the relationship of GRP trajectories and technical efficiency trajectories, economic complexity affects the degree of statistical interconnection of trajectories. With low group assessments of the trajectories interconnection, or low group assessments of economic complexity, the level of interconnection between GRP trajectories and technical efficiency trajectories depends on the structure of strong sectors that determines the specifics of the group.

However, few studies have focused on the impact of AI industry agglomeration on economic complexity. This study uses a unique dataset of 2,503,795 AI enterprises in China collected through web crawlers to measure AI industrial agglomeration and examine the relationship between AI industry agglomeration and economic complexity in 194 Chinese cities based on Marshall industry agglomeration theory. The study's results show that AI industry clustering increases economic complexity. The mechanism analysis indicates that people and knowledge are the channels through which it boosts economic complexity. Unexpectedly, AI industry agglomeration does not improve the economic complexity index (ECI) through the goods path. This study proposes three possible explanations for this result. First, AI industrial clustering may lead to excessive rivalry in China's intermediate product market. Hence, sharing intermediate inputs has no increasing returns effect. Second, the city's high-end talent is not fairly distributed due to China's uneven development. Finally, policies drive the formation of China's AI industrial agglomeration, which does not develop naturally. Consequently, China should implement a talent- and knowledge-driven AI agglomeration. To avoid overcrowding, policies must match regional development.

Terrorism and economic complexity in Africa: The unconditional impact of military expenditure	AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT												Following the rising wave of terrorism in Africa, particularly in the last decade, this study investigated the effect of terrorism on economic complexity in the region as well as the moderating role of military expenditure in the terrorism-economic complexity relationship. A panel of 34 African economies was used over the period 2010-2021. The study also used the dynamic system generalized method of moments framework. We find that the unconditional effect of terrorism on economic complexity in Africa is predominantly negative and significant, and that military expenditure in the region has been ineffective in moderating this adverse effect. This finding remained robust regardless of whether terrorism is measured by the number of terrorism incidents, fatalities, injuries, or hostages. However, our results showed that industrialization, urbanization, and governance institutional quality are potent channels for promoting economic complexity in Africa. Among others, the study emphasized the need for policymakers and leaders in Africa to collaborate at the level of the African Union to address the detrimental effects of terrorism on the continent.

Economic complexity, human capital and income inequality: a cross-country analysis	JAPANESE ECONOMIC REVIEW												This paper investigates the relationship between economic complexity, a measure of economic structures, and income inequality. Using cross-country OLS regression analysis, we show that countries with economic structures geared toward complex products have less inequality. Human capital is found to magnify this correlation but with subtle interaction effects. Concerns about endogeneity bias in the OLS estimates stemming from reverse causality motivate us to estimate a dynamic panel data model, using a system GMM estimator. From the system GMM estimates we find that an increase in economic complexity provokes higher inequality, not less.

It proposes an expanded interpretation of the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) to be applied at the intra-urban context of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, focusing on three different spatial levels of analysis (i.e., local, neighbourhood, and community levels). By applying the index to these three levels, instead of regional or na-tional administrative boundaries commonly used in literature, this study contributes to approximating the observation of economic complexity to the actual geographical scales at which economic interactions take place, allowing for intra-urban comparisons. The proposed ECI includes the service economy, amenities, and retail, in addition to commonly observed manufacturing industry. Methodologically, this case study introduces the Urban Economy Space network diagram to the expanded ECI as an effort to holistically consider all economic sectors happening in a city. The main findings are twofold. First, the city services classified as more complex by the ECI are aligned with the theory of post-industrial economic activities: financial, telecommunications, scientific and technical services, etc. Second, government-led institutions such as healthcare facilities, higher education in-stitutions, etc., appear on the top tier of economic complexity, indicating that local and national governments can contribute to complexifying local economies.

Financial development and economic complexity: The role of country stability	ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE												The aim of this paper is to examine the relationships between financial development (FD), economic complexity and country stability. To achieve this objective, this paper applies a finite mixture model to a sample of 92 developing countries over the period 1995-2018. The study posits that the effect of FD on economic complexity differs across groups of countries with similar but unobserved characteristics. The study finds that the effect of FD on economic complexity varies across four classes of countries, which differ according to their level of economic, political and financial stability. Furthermore, the study argues that stable countries are more likely to be in class 1, including more performing countries - that is, the group of countries where FD spurs economic complexity. This finding remains consistent even when alternative measures of FD and economic complexity are considered. Hence, efforts by developing countries to undertake sound reforms to reduce economic, political and financial risks could help leverage the benefits of FD in fostering the development of sophisticated and complex economies.

J	Lapatinas, A; Litina, A; Zanaj, S				Lapatinas, Athanasios; Litina, Anastasia; Zanaj, Skerdilajda			The Impact of Economic Complexity on the Formation of Environmental Culture	SUSTAINABILITY												This paper establishes economic complexity as a powerful predictor of environmental attitudes. While the economic complexity index (ECI) has been associated with a series of economic outcomes, yet there has not been a link in the literature between ECI and environmental attitudes. This research pushes forward the hypothesis that economic complexity shapes cultural values and beliefs. The research method used is a multilevel empirical analysis that associates aggregate values of the ECI, at the country level, with individual responses related to attitudes towards the environment. Our findings suggest that a marginal increase of the ECI, increases by 0.191 the probability to be a member of environmental organisations and an increase by 0.259 in the probability to engage in voluntary work for the environment. To further reinforce our findings by ensuring identification we replicate the benchmark analysis using as a proxy of a country's level of economic complexity, the average ECI of the neighbouring countries (weighted by population and/or volume of trade). With a similar intention, i.e., to mitigate endogeneity concerns as well as to further frame our findings as "the cultural implications of ECI" we replicate our analysis with a sample of second generation immigrants. The immigrant analysis, suggests that the level of economic complexity of the parents' country of origin, has a long-lasting effect on second generation immigrants' attitudes related to the environment. Because humankind's attitudes and actions are of key importance for a sustainable future, a better understanding as to what drives environmental attitudes appears critical both for researchers and policy makers.

Gender economic inclusion, governance institutions and economic complexity in Africa	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												This study examines the effects of gender economic inclusion on economic complexity in Africa, as well as the moderating role of governance institutions on the relationship between gender inclusion and economic complexity. The analysis was based on the pooled OLS and the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation techniques, with data from 34 African economies between 2010 and 2021. The analysis uncovered several important findings. First, from the most robust model (i.e., GMM), positive synergies are apparent because gender economic inclusion promotes economic complexity, and governance dynamics further enhance the positive effect of gender economic inclusion on economic complexity. Second, regardless of the adopted technique, a predominantly positive and statistically significant relationship was identified between gender economic inclusion and economic complexity. Third, it was observed that while governance institutions exhibit a negative relationship with economic complexity, they play a positive role in moderating the relationship between gender inclusion and economic complexity. Fourth, factors such as foreign direct investment inflow, trade openness, and international tourism were identified as potent drivers of economic complexity in Africa, while the impact of human capital appears to be relatively subdued. Consequently, the study emphasizes the need for institutional reforms to improve governance transparency, accountability, and efficiency, alongside advocating for gender-inclusive policies and increased investment in education.

Because ECI looks to explain the knowledge accumulation in the population and expressed in economic activities, this indicator is often used as a predication for economic growth. Analyzing a panel of 89 countries over the period 2002-2016, our empirical results show that Internet development, institutional quality, and trade openness are key drivers of economic complexity. Our empirical findings lead us to suggest that for the least developed countries, trade openness would help to boost economic complexity while FDI inflows may not be of any benefit. However, for middle-income countries, their technology absorption capacity is higher; as such, both trade openness and FDI inflows can contribute to their expansion of economic complexity. Nonetheless, for most developed countries, economic integration appears to exert (economically insignificant) negative effects on economic complexity. The results, which are checked by a battery of robustness tests also confirm that institutional quality is the major determinant of production fitness.

J	Török, I; Benedek, J; Gómez-Zaldívar, M				Torok, Ibolya; Benedek, Jozsef; Gomez-Zaldivar, Manuel			Quantifying Subnational Economic Complexity: Evidence from Romania	SUSTAINABILITY												Over the last two decades, Romania has undergone strong economic growth, catching up to advanced economies and producing one of the best economic performances in the world. Along with these positive changes, industrial product diversification has increased through expanded foreign economic relations, with all of these supporting the complexity of economic activities. Even though there is a world ranking of countries showing the highest level of economic complexity, there is no information about regional contributions to the overall score in Romania. This paper fills this gap by measuring the economic complexity of Romania's subnational areas (counties) in the last ten years. To calculate the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) at a regional level, 615 economic activities (four-digit classes according to the NACE classification) were taken into consideration, grouped into 68 cluster categories. The results show that significant changes in economic complexity have mainly occurred in less developed areas, the upper- and middle-ranked counties' positions being relatively stable. Furthermore, we examined the impact of complexity on growth and convergence, finding that the ECI index is a good predictor both for future economic growth as well as for the evolution of income inequalities.

J	Chu, LK; Hoang, DP				Lan Khanh Chu; Dung Phuong Hoang			How does economic complexity influence income inequality? New evidence from international data	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY												This paper examines the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality. Using panel data on eighty-eight countries from 2002 to 2017 and two estimation methods, this paper finds that economic complexity is significantly associated with higher income inequality. Moreover, because building economic sophistication is a long and costly process, we further identify whether the changes in the nature of this relationship is conditional on the evolution of other economic and social factors. The results provide qualified evidence that when the level of education, government spending, and trade openness reach certain thresholds, they facilitate the beneficial aspects of higher economic complexity on reducing with income inequality. Conversely, in an environment with less education, ineffective government spending, and low economic openness, economic complexity fails to reduce income inequality. Our findings are relevant for policymakers in tailoring their policies toward combating inequality in the process of developing a knowledge-based economy.

The Failure and Triumph of Economic Complexity: Economic History of Argentina and South Korea in the Second Half of the 20th Century	EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA												Argentina and South Korea are often used to exemplify, respectively, an exceptional episode of economic failure and a rare developmental success story of the second half of the 20th century. As it is argued in the literature, the main reasons for the economic downfall of Argentina were excessive state intervention and regulation. The authors of this article, however, presume that these were rather unsuccessful policies than fundamental problems of the Argentine economy. The level of economic complexity of Argentina was traditionally low, which was a result of an underdeveloped system of mass education and relatively sparse technology adoption. Without serious efforts to diversify its exports and increase its level of economic complexity, this country had little chance to stay among the world's richest economies. That these efforts did not succeed in bringing about a higher level of economic complexity in Argentina did not, at the same time, imply that they were the main reason of its long-term economic stagnation. In this paper, the authors use the economic complexity theory framework to describe the development story of the Argentine economy in the second half of the 20th century in terms of economic complexity and export diversification. The authors show that this country's efforts to develop its industry have resulted only in a minor increase in its level of economic complexity, especially if East Asian economic miracle stories-the one of South Korea in particular-are used as a reference point. The main reasons of this result include a slow pace of human capital accumulation in Argentina. This makes an immense contrast with the vast expansion of secondary and tertiary education in South Korea. Challenges of the Korean government's new industrial policy in the mid-60s and gradual economic diversification stimulated a large-scale education reform, which made South Korea one of the most prominent high-tech economies of the modern world.

Evidence from Italy	ECONOMIA POLITICA												Combining evolutionary economic geography and the recombinant knowledge approach, we test whether the level of entropy in available capabilities affects the level of a region's economic complexity. Merging different data sources on 103 Italian NUTS-3 regions and 9 years (between 2008 and 2016), our panel regressions show that a higher level of economic complexity in a region is explained by a higher average level of entropy in the region's capabilities. We also find this effect stronger in the northern and central regions of Italy, and it is due only to entropy in the available technologies, not in capital or skills. Using structural equation models, we show that variety of skills and relative capital endowment are indirectly linked to the level of economic complexity in Italian regions, since they first stimulate a greater technological diversification.

It provides opportunity and insight on how to mitigate the negative externalities that arises from the increasing pressure on the ecosystem. Based on this account, the effect of economic complexity and the corresponding outlook on environmental degradation vis-a-vis greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions alongside other environmental indicators are examined for the panel of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden for the period 1995 to 2020. After employing Driscoll- Kraay's standard errors for random effect (RE) with individual effects for the examination, the results indicate that the region's level of economic complexity favors environmental sustainability. Contrarily, the economic complexity outlook spurs GHG emissions, thus suggesting that future performance of the region's economic complexity could be detrimental to its ecosystem. Another similar, and undesirable observation is that the increase in urban population hampers environmental quality as it causes a surge in GHG emissions. Meanwhile, the results then conclude that economic growth, economic complexity, and environmental-related technologies are found to be potent drivers of environmental sustainability as the indicators exert negative pressure on GHG emissions in the Nordic region. Important policies that potentially guide immediate, and future sector-wide activities toward enhancing the region's sustainable development programs are posited through the study outcome.

J	Voloshenko, KY				Voloshenko, Ksenia Yu			Economic Security within the Limits of Economic Complexity	REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES												Introduction. The issues of ensuring economic security of regions (especially of those with a specific situation) taking into account the influence of economic complexity are a novel research problem. The development of regions, primarily the border ones, is determined by two divergent processes: growing economic complexity, determined by external constraints or opportunities, and economic security, associated with the internal potential and resources of the region. Based on the study conducted, the article reveals the features of the interconnection between economic security and economic complexity, the latter determining the innovative and technological limitations to the growth and development of territories. Materials and Methods. The author has conducted semantic analysis and thematic clustering of economic security using data from bibliographic and reference databases of publications in English (Web of Science) and in Russian (eLIBRARY.RU). The assessment of economic complexity was based on the conducted analysis of the UN Comtrade foreign trade statistics, that of economic security - on the official data published by Rosstat. Results. The author has identified the terminological connection between economic security and economic complexity, and has provided a theoretical representation of the relations and interdependence of these categories. The paper presents the methodological provisions for studying the economic security of border regions, taking into consideration the possibilities for increasing their economic complexity. Discussion and Conclusion. In the context of systemic constraints in the development of the region, economic security is largely determined by both the available internal potential and resources, and the possibilities of their use. However, the region gains new capabilities with the increase in its economic complexity, the latter also limiting its economic security. In fact, the choice of key areas for the structural transformation of the region's economy depends on whether priority is given to maintaining the level of economic security or increasing economic complexity. The mechanism and criteria discussed in this paper, as well as the methodological provisions of such a choice, contribute to further development of the theory of economic security and economic complexity at the regional level and are of practical importance for regional governance.																			2413-1407	2587-8549				APR-JUN	2021	29	2					401	426		10.15507/2413-1407.115.029.202102.401-426	http://dx.doi.org/10.15507/2413-1407.115.029.202102.401-426													WOS:000662257900008
J	Al-Ayouty, I				Al-Ayouty, Iman			Economic Complexity and Renewable Energy Effects on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: a Panel Data Analysis of Middle East and North Africa Countries	JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY												With the rising economic complexity of the world economy, applied research has been focusing on the economic complexity-environmental quality nexus. Many of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries and Turkey show relatively low economic complexity with undiversified product spaces. The present study is thereby motivated to investigate the economic complexity-environmental quality relation for the MENA countries and Turkey. Using panel data for eighteen MENA countries and Turkey over the period 1990-2020, the fully modified ordinary least squares method of estimation is employed in two separate models, and Granger causality tests are performed. Each model includes the relation of economic complexity to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, one form of energy (renewable or non-renewable), population density and variables to validate the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. In model (1), a negative and statistically significant renewable energy consumption has a mitigating effect on CO2 emissions, though economic complexity and its interaction with renewable energy consumption are not statistically significant. In model (2), a positive and statistically significant non-renewable energy indicates that increased fossil fuel reliance increases CO2 emissions (deteriorating environmental quality), while a negative and statistically significant economic complexity and population density reduce CO2 emissions (improving environmental quality), respectively. The EKC hypothesis is validated for the MENA countries and Turkey in both models (1) and (2), and Granger causality test results are given. Among the key policy implications are that the MENA countries and Turkey must recognize that increasing GDP and industrialization must be coupled with moving from less- to more-knowledge-based structures.																			1868-7865	1868-7873				2023 OCT 31	2023										10.1007/s13132-023-01540-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13132-023-01540-1		OCT 2023											WOS:001096143000003

Instead of using traditional economic and environmental factors, the authors used economic complexity and ecological footprint as key factors. Taking into account the dynamic nature of the relationship between economic activities and the environment, the recently developed Quantile ARDL (QARDL) model is employed. The results of the Quantile Granger-causality show bidirectional causality between economic growth, economic complexity, and ecological footprint in low and high quantiles. Likewise, QARDL findings reveal that there is asymmetric positive relation between economic growth and environment both in the short-run and long-run. Therefore, the long run cointegration and causality between economic complexity and ecological footprint suggest that policy efforts towards product diversification hold the potential to solve ecological problem.

Foreign direct investment and economic complexity in emerging economies	ECONOMIC JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS												Purpose ? In this study, we investigate the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic complexity in MINT and BRICS countries.Methodology ? Data on economic complexity from MIT's Observatory of Economic Complexity and data on FDI and other determinants of economic complexity are sourced from World Development indicators which spanned between 1991 and 2020. The countries are divided into three categories: All countries pooled together, MINT and BRICS countries. We employ panel co-integrating regression.Findings ? Findings based on panel co-integration regression show that foreign direct investment positively impacts economic complexity in all the countries and MINT countries, while its impact is negative in BRICS countries.Originality ? This study adds value to the literature by scrutinizing the nexus between FDI and economic complexity in the context of emerging economies and employs the panel co-integration technique for robust analysis. The study's findings shed light on the need for governments in developing countries to implement appropriate policies encouraging FDI inflows into their respective countries. Contributing to the host country's economic complexity, FDI inflows should be focused on highly technical investment and, most importantly, should be selective to enhance the development of priority sectors. An investment promotion policy may be required to encourage foreign investment in the host country.

Our empirical analysis finds that the influence of GVC participation on economic complexity varies across quantiles as it has adverse and significant effects on economic complexity in the first five lower quantiles (5th - 25th). It indicates that GVC participation has adverse impacts on economic complexity except for the economy with higher economic complexity. Moreover, forward participation is negatively associated with economic complexity in all the quantiles except for the 90th quantile. In countries with lower and moderate economic complexity, forward participation has a negative impact on how complex the economy is.

SUSTAINABILITY												Recent research on the effects of the productive structure of an economy has turned to examining whether economic complexity is associated with lower income inequality. In contrast to the commonly adopted approach that estimates the impact of economic complexity in a cross-country setting, we use panel data for Brazilian states to identify the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality at the sub-national level. Our findings show that the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality has an inverted U-shape, indicating that growing levels of complexity first worsen and then improve the income distribution in Brazilian states. Our findings also show that this relationship is particularly prominent in those states that have relatively high levels of urbanization and overall development. Furthermore, we identify separate effects on income inequality from the degree to which regional productive structures are characterised by diversity in terms of industries and occupations. These effects are particularly pronounced in less developed states with a more rural character. In combination, these findings confirm the important role that the productive structure plays in processes that drive improvements in income distributions and suggest that more research on this impact is warranted at the regional level.

Evidence from (non)-parametric panel techniques	AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT												Economic complexity is an indicator of a nation's productive capabilities. It therefore determines the nature and quality of the products that a country can put up for exports. This suggests that building economic complexity can serve as a channel through which African countries can boost export competitiveness. To this end, the impact of economic complexity on the export volume of Africa's top 10 exporting countries which jointly account for about 78% of total trade volume on the continent for the period 2000-2018, is examined. Employing a parametric common correlated effects mean group estimation technique and a non-parametric time-varying model with fixed effects technique, this study shows that economic complexity is indeed a determinant of export competitiveness. However, its effect is not as powerful as those of GDP, real exchange rate, trade openness and foreign direct investment. This suggests that, although policies that emphasize economic complexity are useful, they should not be treated as stand-alone policies. Instead, governments should adopt holistic trade policy reforms that take economic complexity into account, along with other factors such as exchange rates, economic growth, trade openness and foreign direct investment.

Using data on 14,873 Chinese subsidiaries in 78 countries for 2007-2015, we find that investment is associated with locations with lower economic complexity. This applies especially for destination countries within the OECD and MNCs in knowledge-intensive industries, whereas firms with a strong knowledge base may instead seek out locations with high economic complexity. Results are consistent with a strategy of accessing relatively low-complexity capabilities that can be accumulated to build and reinforce the international advantage and competitiveness of the multinational.

This study has preferred the Fourier autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) method, which Banerjee et al. (2017) introduced to the literature. The unit root processes of the variables added to the model were investigated using both conventional and Fourier unit root tests. As a result of the Fourier ADL cointegration test, a long-term relationship was found to exist among the variables. The fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) test was used to estimate the short- and long-term coefficients. Empirical findings have revealed energy consumption in Turkiye during this sample period to have increased the ecological footprint both in the short and long terms. The result was obtained that economic complexity increased the ecological footprint in the short run while decreasing in the long run. Meanwhile, short-term elasticity of economic growth (0.90%) was concluded to be greater compared to long-term elasticity (0.24%), and validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis was obtained for Turkiye.					karadeniz yılmaz, yasemin/JQW-8370-2023; OZBEK, Sefa/JYP-8810-2024														2602-4152	2602-3954					2022	72	1					407	431		10.26650/ISTJECON2022-1061837	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ISTJECON2022-1061837													WOS:000848656200016

Taking into consideration the heterogeneity among European countries, the heterogeneous panel technique is used, including panel estimation through fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). The empirical findings indicate a long-term equilibrium relationship between economic complexity, energy consumption structure and greenhouse gas emission within all three panels. Economic complexity and energy consumption structure have a statistically significant impact on greenhouse gas emission within all panels, but the influence is higher within the subpanel of countries with a lower level of economic complexity, suggesting a higher risk of pollution as the economic complexity grows and as the energy balance inclines in favor of non-renewable energy consumption. Our paper suggests that the economic complexity is a variable that must be taken into consideration when national economic and energy policies are shaped. Finally, policy implications for each panel of countries are discussed.

The robust least square technique is applied for empirical analysis. The findings of the study reveal that the economic complexity, institutions and per capita income have significant negative impact while economic misery and population growth have significant positive relationship on violent crimes. Moreover, efficient institutions have prime importance to curb the crimes in a society. The better provision of knowledge and highly skilled labor force in an efficient institutional environment for alleviation of crimes is suggested as a policy tool.

To achieve this, we calculated the modified regional development trap for Turkey by incorporating past regional performances and deviations from the national average. We also employed two different economic complexity measures derived from the literature. Our analysis indicates a negative correlation between regional development trap and economic complexity, suggesting that provinces with more complex productive structures may be less likely to fall into the trap.

J	Shirazi, M; Fuinhas, JA				Shirazi, Masoud; Fuinhas, Jose Alberto			Portfolio decisions of primary energy sources and economic complexity: The world?s large energy user evidence	RENEWABLE ENERGY												Sustainable energy systems are sensitive to economic complexity, i.e., the combination of knowledge, innovation, and productivity, since it affects the countries' portfolio decisions of primary energy sources, shaping geopolitics, and contributing to global energy security. This research assesses the impact of economic complexity on the performance of two energy systems measurements, e.g., diversification of primary energy demand (D.P.E.D) and non-carbon-based fuel portfolio (N.C.F.P), controlling for energy intensity, energy prices, resource supply diversity, and CO2 emissions in a panel of 25 large energy-using countries during 1998-2018. The findings support the long-run and causal relationships across energy systems using the panel cointegration methods and dynamic panel models. Specifically, economic complexity's statistically significant and positive effect on D.P.E.D and N.C. F.P is detected. Moreover, the contribution of N.C.F.P to total energy demand is more elastic than D.P.E.D when the shares of economic complexity and the control variables increase. Results also indicate that the cyclical movements of economic complexity are not related to energy systems fluctuations across large energy-consuming economies. Consequently, the role of economic complexity in sustainable energy systems is a necessary condition to overcome the barriers in achieving (i) resource abundance and equitability and (ii) a non-carbon-based fuel portfolio for large energy consumers.

Recent decades have seen a global transformation in IPR standards, underpinned by the theory that stronger IPRs spur increased incentives to innovate. This study tests the impact of ever more rigorous IPR systems on innovation through an index of economic complexity of 94 countries from 1965 to 2005. Our results confirm that stronger intellectual property systems engender higher levels of economic complexity.

Our results suggest that the concentration of manufacturing production among the countryss states evolved according to the predictions of standard models of international trade. However, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had aparticular effect on each individual state, depending on its economic structure. More complex states, i.e., those more productively diverse and specialized in more sophisticated manufacturing goods, experienced a higher increase in their level ofproduction concentration after NAFTA and were less affected by competition from Chinese exports to the U.S. In contrast, NAFTA had a less significant impact on the production concentration of less complex states, while competition from China halted their move towards greater specialization and even reversed it somewhat. These findings highlight the important role of international trade in shaping the development of the economic structure ofMexican states in the period under analysis.

This study probes the impact of technological and vertical relatedness on manufacturing structural rationalisation and advancement by constructing a panel data model with province and year fixed effects using data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2019. The empirical results show that manufacturing structural change differs based on industrial relatedness. Specifically, at the national level, technological relatedness can promote both structural rationalisation and advancement within manufacturing. Vertical relatedness holds a negative effect on structural rationalisation and no significant effect on structural advancement. Besides, the effects of industrial relatedness exhibit regional heterogeneity. In coastal China, technological relatedness can still promote structural rationalisation and advancement. Vertical relatedness has no significant effect on structural rationalisation and a negative effect on structural advancement. In inland China, governmental supports help break the dependency of regional manufacturing structural change on industrial relatedness, and the establishment of development zones restrains structural rationalisation within manufacturing. This study offers insights for policymakers to adopt different approaches to support local manufacturing development, depending on the characteristics of regional manufacturing structural evolution.

Using quarterly data on Italian provinces for 2008-2018 and adopting a dynamic (spatial) econometric approach, the work provides robust evidence highlighting how local economic complexity reduces the barriers to accessing local credit markets. With a greater "qualified" diversification (higher economic complexity), banks access successful projects with greater probability and are more willing to grant credit. The estimation results also reveal the existence of long-run spatial spillover effects. The empirical findings advocate for a nuanced and context-specific policy framework.

First, a Product Space analysis identifies industrial niches, which Tanzania should promote to increase economic complexity and stimulate structural transformation. The identification of industries is based on a supply-side network method following the literature on economic complexity. Second, we combine the complexity analysis with a gravity model, identifying industries with high, demand-driven export potential. In combination, the supply-and-demand framework finds industries that are complex, feasible to target given Tanzania's existing know-how and profitable to export given product-specific trade resistance and geographically dispersed demand. Third, we construct an employment absorption index to identify industries with a high labour intensity. Our findings suggest a high export potential and scope for learning spillovers in complex sectors, such as machinery and chemicals. In contrast, less complex sectors, such as agro-processing, metal and wood, are correlated with higher employment creation.

RENEWABLE ENERGY												This research evaluates how energy (geothermal and coal), economic complexity, and technological innovation impact the ecological footprint in newly industrialized countries (NICs), considering the period 1990-2018. The authors employed economic complexity, technological innovation, and ecological footprint as significant considerations instead of standard environmental and economic parameters. The study used cross-sectional augmented distributed lag (CS-ARDL) and the pairwise Dumitrescu-Hurlin (DH) panel causality to consider the dynamic character of the correlation between the Environment and economic activities. The outcomes of the CS-ARDL showed that economic growth and coal energy intensify ecological footprint in both the long and short run. However, CS-ARDL results revealed that geothermal energy consumption, economic complexity, and technological innovation lessen the ecological footprint in NICs in the long and short run. Finally, the DH causality results revealed a unidirectional causality from geothermal, technological innovation, economic complexity, and coal energy use to ecological footprint. This demonstrates that all the exogenous variables have a predicted power on the ecological footprints in NICs. Based on these findings, policy measures to diversify products have the potential to tackle ecological problems.

J	Gómez-Zaldívar, M; Gómez-Zaldívar, F				Gomez-Zaldivar, Manuel; Gomez-Zaldivar, Fernando			Municipal Economic Complexity in Mexico: Productive Capabilities, Wealth, Economic Growth, and Business Sophistication	REVIEW OF REGIONAL STUDIES												In this study, we calculate the productive capabilities of Mexico's municipalities (i.e., their Economic Complexity Index, or ECI) and the productive capabilities required for their economic activities to be carried out (i.e., the ECI of their economic activities). We do this in order to determine whether or not the differences in the main municipal economic indicators (such as levels of wealth, economic growth rates, and salaries) are associated with differences in productive capabilities. Specifically, our results illus-trate: i) a considerable heterogeneity, in terms of productive capabilities, across municipalities; ii) a positive relationship between the level of economic complexity of municipalities and their level of wealth and rate of economic growth, and iii) a positive relationship between the complexity of economic activities and the average salaries received by those employed in them. Furthermore, by finding that the majority of new firms in complex (non-complex) municipalities generally tend to engage in more sophisticated/higher-value-added (less sophisticated/lower-value-added) economic activities, we provide supporting evidence on the gradual accumulation of productive capabilities within municipalities to the literature on evolutionary economic geography. According to this literature, this is how economies generally develop, i.e., by gradually accumu-lating productive capabilities so as to become more diverse and be able to engage in more complex economic activities, allowing economies to grow and become wealthier.

In the same pursuits, economic complexity demonstrates the sophistication of technology which is highly associated with environmental quality and renewable energy transition. Therefore, the present study is intended to explore the roles of economic complexity and renewable energy in pollution alleviation and precisely in alleviating carbon emissions in the BRICS countries. In doing so, this study applied novel Method of Moments Quantile regression using annual data from 1995 to 2018. The overall results produce emissions mitigating effects of economic complexity and renewable energy mainly at higher emissions quantiles. The interaction of both variables suggests that economic complexity leads to renewable energy transition, which reduce carbon emissions more pronouncedly. These results suggest that there is a need to strategize the pathway for the potential investments to be made in the sector of renewable energy along with the areas of technology, innovation, human resource development and R&D which eventually improve economic complexity and environmental sustainability.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Antonietti, R; Franco, C				Antonietti, Roberto; Franco, Chiara			From FDI to economic complexity: a panel Granger causality analysis	STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS												In this paper, we assess whether attracting higher amounts of FDI induces a greater level of economic complexity in a country. Using a panel of 117 countries and 22 years, from 1995 to 2016, we test for the causal relationship between inward FDI and economic complexity using a panel VAR approach and Impulse Response Functions. We find that accumulating a higher stock of inward FDI per capita Granger causes a greater economic complexity in a country, and not vice versa. This causal effect is very small, however, and occurs only in countries with above-average levels of GDP per capita, tertiary education, tertiarization or financial development. We also find that only greenfield FDIs Granger-cause economic complexity in developed countries. Finally, knowledge-intensive greenfield projects are the only type of FDI that Granger-cause complexity in a less developed country, but the estimated effect is near zero and disappears after two years.

J	Vu, TV				Vu, Trung V.			Linking LGBT inclusion and national innovative capacity	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH												This paper investigates the relationship between the social inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and technological innovation. It empirically establishes that LGBT inclusion helps foster human capital skills, thus strengthening national innovative capacity. Exploiting cross-country data, this research provides suggestive evidence that social tolerance towards homosexuality is positively correlated with the economic complexity index, a novel measure of cross-country differences in innovative capabilities. Individual-level analyses, based on data from the World Values Survey, reveal that surveyed respondents who self-report tolerance towards homosexual acts tend to have positive attitudes towards technological innovation, ceteris paribus. This lends credence to the international evidence. Further analyses indicate that the link between LGBT inclusion and innovation is partially mediated through the accumulation of human capital. The main findings suggest that the social exclusion of LGBT people, at least to some extent, impedes long-run economic development by hindering innovative activities.

In this study, the effects of economic complexity index, export and gross fixed capital formation variables on per capita income are analyzed for 18 countries in the G-20 community. The findings of the study reveals positive impact of economic complexity index on per capita income for Brazil, China, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Turkey and the US while revealing negative impact for Argentina, Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. Brazil is the only country differentiates from the other countries in the sense of having the increasing export share of primary products (raw materials and intermediate goods) while having decreasing export share of manufactured products and also in the sense of having positive significant relationship between the economic complexity level and per capita income.

J	Lopes, JC; Dias, J; Amaral, JF				Lopes, Joao; Dias, Joao; Amaral, Joao			Assessing economic complexity as interindustry connectedness in nine OECD countries	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF APPLIED ECONOMICS												Economic complexity can be defined as the level of interdependence between the component parts of an economy. In input-output systems interindustry connectedness is a crucial feature of analysis, and there are many different methods of measuring it. Most of the measures however, have important drawbacks to be used as a good indicator of economic complexity, because they were not explicitly made with this purpose in mind. In this paper, we present, discuss and compare empirically different indexes of economic complexity as intersectoral connectedness, using the inter-industry tables of nine OECD countries. According to most of the measures of connectedness large economies (USA, Japan) tend to be more complex than small economies (for example, Denmark). But if another type of measures is considered, the opposite conclusion is drawn, signalling a hidden characteristic of interdependence that so far has not been detected by conventional measures. This result should qualify the widespread idea that more interconnected productive structures propagate more intensely exogenous shocks and/or economic policy measures.					; Lopes, Joao/G-4924-2018	amaral, joao/0000-0002-6880-4641; Lopes, Joao/0000-0002-7805-2279													0269-2171	1465-3486					2012	26	6					811	827		10.1080/02692171.2012.665852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02692171.2012.665852													WOS:000210983200005

In this context, countries worldwide undertake strategies to combat CO2 emissions and obtain a carbon neutrality objective. The present study analyzed carbon neutrality objectives for the ten largest economies in Africa, spanning 1990 to 2018. This research also investigated the influence of globalization and economic complexity on carbon neutrality objectives. The study applied the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), and Fixed Effect model for its analysis. The research indicated that economic complexity and economic growth (GDP) positively impact CO2 emission, which adversely affects the carbon neutrality objective. However, financial development, globalization, population, and renewable energy consumption are efficient for attaining carbon neutrality objectives; the pairwise Granger causality results in bidirectional causality between economic growth, population, and CO2 emissions. Unidirectional causality runs from the CO2 emissions to renewable energy, globalization, and economic complexity. Specifically, the FMOLS statistics suggest that a percent rise in economic complexity and economic growth increases CO2 emissions by 82.1% and 25.5%. In contrast, a unit increase in financial development, globalization, population, and renewable energy consumption leads to a decline in CO2 emissions by 21.7%, 48.4%, 18.5%, and 3.1%. Empirical evidence offers policy implications that would enable the largest economies in Africa to accomplish the carbon neutrality objective by adjusting the policies in addressing economic growth and economic complexity. Also, adequate attention should be devoted to globalization adaptability.

J	Al-Silefanee, R				Al-Silefanee, Rebean			The role of economic complexity in shaping the energy-growth nexus: Evidence from cross-country panel data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT-IJRED												The study investigated the interplay between energy consumption (EN), economic growth (EG), and economic complexity across 59 countries from 2000 to 2018. Employing panel data methods, the research examined various models to estimate long-term effects while addressing unobserved heterogeneity and potential biases. Results indicate significant relationships between EG, EN, and economic complexity. Notably, the economic complexity index (ECI) displayed a positive effect on economic development, while trade openness and foreign direct investment showed varying impacts. The study identified a positive association between EG and EN, suggesting that increased energy consumption accompanies economic growth. However, a higher capital -to -labor ratio was associated with lower EN, indicating a substitution effect. Of particular note is the significant positive impact of the interaction between ECI and EN on GDP across various models. In the Country Fixed Effects Model, a one -unit increase in the interaction correlated with a 0.026 unit increase in GDP (p < 0.001). Similarly, significant positive relationships were observed in the Panel EGLS and FMOLS models, with coefficients of 0.055 and 0.031, respectively (p < 0.001 and p = 0.011). Conversely, all models consistently demonstrated a negative relationship between economic complexity and GDP, with coefficients ranging from -0.062 to -0.089 (p < 0.001). These findings underscore the importance of considering economic complexity and energy consumption in policy interventions aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth. Policymakers are encouraged to adopt comprehensive approaches that account for the complex interplay of various factors influencing economic development and energy consumption to formulate effective strategies.																			2252-4940					MAR	2024	13	2					256	269		10.61435/ijred.2024.60055	http://dx.doi.org/10.61435/ijred.2024.60055													WOS:001186965000014

A popular approach to measure semantic similarity and relatedness is utilizing WordNet, a lexical database. This paper shows that Wordnet's gloss is a potential source for measuring semantic relatedness.

Given that this branch of literature is relatively young, the determinants of economic sophistication have not yet been fully explored. This study contributes to this literature by examining the effect of research and development (R&D) investments on economic complexity. By applying a dynamic panel model to a panel of 67 countries, the following results are established: First, the results showed that research and development investments are associated with greater economic complexity. Second, when analyzing R&D by sector, the results highlight the importance of research spending by higher education, business, public sector and private non-profit sector in improving economic complexity. In the same vein, investments in different R&D activities, including basic research, applied research and experimental research, increase economic complexity. In addition, we provided evidence that R&D spending in several fields, including medicine, engineering, natural sciences, social sciences and arts, also increases economic complexity. Third, we further analyze the heterogeneity of the results, highlighting the role of natural resource endowment and income level. However, investments in research and development remain associated with higher levels of economic complexity in resource-poor countries in contrast to resource-rich countries, where they have no effect. Based on these results, policy implications were discussed.																			2577-6975	2577-6983				2023 OCT 31	2023										10.1111/ecot.12400	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecot.12400		OCT 2023											WOS:001093413900001

The analysis is conducted using data of the pharmaceutical industry for the period 1988-2004. The empirical results suggest that merged companies have on average, worse performances than the group of non-merging firms. This result is confirmed when I account for the endogeneous formation of mergers by selecting a control group first using the propensity score method and then taking into account the technological relatedness of the firms. Finally, I find that higher levels of technological relatedness are not associated with better R&D outcomes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results suggest that the country's states differ markedly in terms of the activities they specialize in, and therefore also in terms of their economic complexity. There is also a clear regional pattern which shows that states in the north are more complex, those in the central region have an intermediate level of complexity, and those in the south have the lowest levels of complexity. As previous international studies have shown, complexity is an important factor in explaining the economic disparities observed in the country, given that its measure is positively related to both the level of wealth and the growth rate of the states. Therefore, we can assert that the dispersion of productive knowledge-measured according to the specialization of the states or the location of the various economic activities performed there-goes some way toward explaining their different patterns of growth.																			1553-0892						2017	47	2					201	219																WOS:000443687400005

Our aim is to investigate the complexity of ISNs adopting a similar approach to that developed by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) to measure the country economic complexity. In particular, we define a complexity index measuring the economic complexity of the firms involved in an ISN and provide some applications to real case studies. Design/methodology/approach - We define two matrixes, one identifying the waste each firm produces, and the other mapping the wastes each firm uses. Using these matrixes, we compute four indexes: 1) the diversity index of the firm producing wastes exchanged; 2) the diversity index of the firm using the wastes; 3) the ubiquity index of the waste exchanged in terms of number of the firms producing it; and 4) the ubiquity index of the waste exchanged in terms of number of the firms using them. A overall firm complexity measure is defined by using these indices. Originality/value - This paper made a methodological advance in the study of complexity within ISNs by applying an economic complexity approach. Complexity of ISNs is a fundamental property of the system, because it allows adaption and emergence useful to improve performance, which thus should be exploited rather than reduced. The approach proposed here allows the firm complexity to be assessed in a simple manner, without requiring high computational efforts like in other methods developed in the literature, but at the same time in a rigorous way, because the main driver of the economic complexity is taken into account. Practical implications - The study provides a rating of firms in a ISN based on the complexity index, which is useful to identify the most critical firms in terms of impact on the network resilience. The higher the firm complexity, the higher the risk that the firm unavailability due to a disruptive event can cause problem for the survival of the ISN.

To this end, we extend the traditional bivariate Quantile-on-Quantile Regression to the multivariate case. The empirical results provide time-varying effects of economic complexity, economic growth, FDI, trade openness, and urbanization on energyrelated environmental risks. Particularly, the effect of economic complexity is negative and weak in the extremely lower quantiles of energy-related environmental risks, while it is positive and stronger in the middle and higher quantiles. The implication of these results is that economic complexity only condenses energy-related environmental risks when such environmental risks caused by energy-related factors are extremely low. Furthermore, economic growth and tradeopenness stimulate energy-related environmental risks but the effects of FDI and urbanization reduce energy-related environmental risks. Therefore, these findings provide insights into achieving environmental sustainability targets in the USA.					karadeniz yılmaz, yasemin/JQW-8370-2023; Özkan, Oktay/HZL-8977-2023; alola, andrew/M-8665-2019; alola, andrew/AAO-6120-2020; USMAN, OJONUGWA/ABE-6939-2020; Özkan, Oktay/ISV-0801-2023	Özkan, Oktay/0000-0001-9419-8115; alola, andrew/0000-0001-5355-3707; Özkan, Oktay/0000-0001-9419-8115; Haruna, Roselyn Afor/0000-0003-3382-3778; Ghardallou, wafa/0000-0002-2625-2164													0954-349X	1873-6017				JUN	2023	65						382	392		10.1016/j.strueco.2023.03.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2023.03.010		MAR 2023											WOS:000967359600001
J	Piras, R				Piras, Romano			Remittances, economic complexity, and new firms' creation: empirical evidence from a large sample of countries	ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING												One of the most debated issues in migration economics regards the effects of remittances in receiving countries. In this paper, we test whether the economic complexity of a country is relevant for understanding the impact of remittances on new firms' birth. We find evidence that the impact of real per capita remittances on new firms' creation is inversely mediated by economic complexity. More (less) complex economies generate opportunities to found new firms which need high (low) funding. Since economic complexity is positively correlated with economic development, remittances are more likely to facilitate the establishment of new firms in less developed economies rather than in more advanced ones. We also examine the link between remittances and new firm creation for Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean countries, finding very heterogeneous patterns. Hence, policy implications aiming at attracting remittances to create new firms should respond to the challenges posed by specific countries and be tailored to their peculiar needs. Countries of origin should build institutions and facilitate the creation of networks to bridge the diaspora abroad with their home country to increase awareness of new business opportunities. Policy initiatives could spur investment in the formal economy by making regulations less stringent, discouraging the use of remittances for consumption purposes, reducing informality, improving competition, reducing remittance transfer costs, and giving incentives to new firms created through remittances.

J	Wang, F; Wu, M; Wang, JC				Wang, Feng; Wu, Min; Wang, Jingcao			Can increasing economic complexity improve China?s green development efficiency?	ENERGY ECONOMICS												In the context of China's efforts to promote green development, how to improve the green development effi-ciency (GDE) has become an increasingly important research topic. Promoting the transformation towards a knowledge-and technology-intensive economic structure may be an important way to improve the GDE. Therefore, this study examines the impact of economic structural transformation represented by economic complexity on China's GDE. This study first measures the economic complexity index (ECI) and GDE of China's provinces using the method of reflections and data envelopment analysis window model, then examines the impact of the ECI on China's GDE based on a panel data model. It further analyses the contribution of ECI to regional differences in GDE and the mechanism of the effect of ECI on GDE using the regression-based Shapley decomposition analysis approach and a mediating effect model, respectively. Five conclusions are obtained as follows. Firstly, the ECI in China decreased from the east to the west, while the GDE shows the characteristics of 'a higher GDE in the east and south and a lower GDE in the west and north'. Secondly, the empirical results show that the ECI has a significant positive impact on the GDE, and the results of the robustness tests support this finding. This indicates that increasing economic complexity plays an important role in promoting the green development of China's provinces. Thirdly, significant regional differences exist in the impact of economic complexity on the GDE. Fourthly, the decomposition results of regional differences in the GDE suggest that economic complexity is a primary factor that causes the differences in the GDE among China's provinces. Fifthly, the estimation results of the mediating effect model indicate that increasing economic complexity can improve the GDE by enhancing innovation and human capital levels. These findings suggest that China can promote regional green development by developing policies related to enhancing economic complexity and fully releasing the effects of economic complexity on innovation and human capital.																			0140-9883	1873-6181				JAN	2023	117								106443	10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106443		DEC 2022											WOS:000903476800012

Linking Economic Complexity, Institutions, and Income Inequality	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												A country's mix of products predicts its subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products-as measured by the Economic Complexity Index-have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related products-or product space-to illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality. Finally, we make our results available through an online resource that allows for its users to visualize the structural transformation of over 150 countries and their associated changes in income inequality during 1963-2008.

J	Can, M; Brusselaers, J; Mercan, M				Can, Muhlis; Brusselaers, Jan; Mercan, Mehmet			The effect of export composition on energy demand: A fresh evidence in the context of economic complexity	REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS												Energy is pivotal for sustainable economic growth. Undoubtedly, the role of the composition of the export basket (measured as economic complexity) is one of the crucial variables influencing energy consumption. Despite its importance, the existing body of literature does not intensively study the relationship between economic complexity and total energy consumption. Therefore, this study's primary aim was to examine the effect of economic complexity on energy consumption in a case study of 21 developed and 44 developing countries for the period 1971-2014. In this context, economic complexity expresses the level of sophistication of a country's export basket. This paper considers energy prices and income as explanatory variables in Durbin-H panel cointegration analysis and applies a cointegration test with structural breaks to check for the long-run relationships. For the long-run estimations, we employ the augmented mean group method and dynamic seemingly unrelated regression. The findings reveal that economic complexity increases energy consumption in developing countries while it decreases energy consumption in developed countries. This is an important insight for countries concerned about their energy dependence. The diversification of their production and export baskets can reduce energy needs. The paper finally presents policy recommendations based on the empirical estimates.

The empirical analysis consistently shows that (1) institutional quality has a positive impact on economic sophistication; (2) each component of institutions has a distinct effect on economic sophistication; and (3) the contribution of institutions on economic sophistication across country sub-groups is heterogeneous.

J	Ashraf, J				Ashraf, Junaid			Do political instability, financial instability and environmental degradation undermine growth? Evidence from belt and road initiative countries	JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING												This study investigates the extent to which political instability (PI), financial instability (FI), and environmental degradation undermine economic complexity (EC). EC is more predictive of future growth and development patterns and correlates with the increased ability to create and export a wide variety of sophisticated (high productivity) items. Using data from up to 56 BRI nations, I routinely obtain precise estimates of the negative effect of PI and FI on EC. Further, we examined the indirect effect of PI and FI through the channel of human capital (HC). These findings confirm the core premise that institutional stability largely influences economic complexity by encouraging creative entrepreneurship, HC accumulation, and allocating human resources to productive activities. Moreover, we examined the indirect effect of PI and FI through the channel of CO2 emissions. These findings support the idea that countries with stable institutions can reduce pollution and protect the environment. It could increase economic complexity while reducing environmental degradation. The main findings support the creation of a pro-development institutional framework that enhance environmental sustainability and reduces poverty by increasing economic complexity.

Therefore, economic justice has always been a concern of governments because of its undeniable economic and social consequences. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of macroeconomic variables such as economic complexity, scientific productivity and various economic, financial and political risks on the situation of income inequality in developing economies during the years 2000-2019, using an econometric Panel-VAR method. The results showed that income inequality in selected middle-income developing countries is moving towards better status due to an increase in scientific productivity and a reduction in economic, financial and political risks. While income inequality decreases as economic complexity increases above a certain threshold. The results of the analysis of variance decomposition showed that among the explanatory variables, the economic complexity has the largest share in describing the Gini coefficient as the index of income inequality distribution.

Therefore, while testing the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve, the ecological footprint as the indicator of environmental degradation will be used as the dependent variable within the model, while the economic complexity index used together with the per capita income and the trade-to-GDP ratio will be used as the independent variables. The analysis confirms the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve for the top nine industrialized countries in terms of the value-added by industry as a percentage of the GDP between 1970 and 2017. In addition, the study shows that economic complexity decreases an economy's ecological footprint.

In general, the non-parametric results present the relationship between efficiency in manufacturing subsectors and economic complexity as an inverted U shape.

J	Qian, C; Madni, GR				Qian, Chen; Madni, Ghulam Rasool			Encirclement of Natural Resources, Green Investment, and Economic Complexity for Mitigation of Ecological Footprints in BRI Countries	SUSTAINABILITY												Environmental deterioration has been increasing constantly for many years and has become the major reason for climatic changes. Consequently, policy makers and researchers are enquiring into the factors affecting environmental quality. The earlier literature describes little about the impact of economic complexity, natural resources, and green investment on ecological footprint for countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), so this research is an effort to close this gap for the 45 BRI countries covering the time period 1995-2020. We applied a number of methods to address the issue of cross-sectional dependence, then cointegration is determined through the Lagrange multiplier bootstrap method. The Driscoll-Kraay standard error method is employed to find the long-run estimates while the robustness of the estimated findings is checked through panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS). The estimated outcomes suggest a significant negative effect of green investment on ecological footprint while natural resources, economic complexity, economic growth, and globalization have significant and positive effects on ecological footprint. These conclusions provide profound insight into natural resources, green investments, and economic complexity for sustainable development of the environment in BRI participating economies and provide a meaningful reference for ecological safety for other economies in the world. This study also highlights some necessary insights for policy makers and practitioners engaged in obtaining the target of sustainable development policies.

The present study employs robust econometric techniques including Augmented Mean Group with Fully Modified-Ordinary Least Squares estimators as estimation techniques. Empirical outcome shows both inverted IL-Shaped and N-Shaped EKC relationship between ECI and CO2 emission. The empirical findings also lend support to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, which suggest that foreign direct investment influx is a contributing factor to environmental degradation in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa economies. Furthermore, renewable energy and the interaction between economic complexity index and urbanization is found to have adverse impact on emission while natural resources and urbanization have positive impact on the environment. Finally, the results from the Dumitrecu and Hurlin causality reveals a bi-directional causality between economic complexity and CO2 emission. Similar causality is found between economic complexity index and urbanization and CO2 emission while a one-way causality is seen running from foreign direct investment to CO2 emission over study period. These findings encourage authorities of the investigated countries to offer a broader energy strategy on alternative energies i.e., renewables improve Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa environmental quality. Furthermore, emphasis on economic strategies that foster a healthier manufacturing activity to engender environmental sustainability without compromise for economic prosperity should be pursued among the examined economies.

J	Libman, AM				Libman, A. M.			Economic and educational complexity in the Russian regions: Should they go hand in hand with each other?	ZHURNAL NOVAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA-JOURNAL OF THE NEW ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION												We establish a positive association between economic and educational complexity, both at the country level, as well as for the Russian regions. As for the latter, we observe a higher variance of educational complexity, while economic complexity fluctuates noticeably less. A number of regions features a higher education system that stands considerably ahead of the development of the corresponding regional economy. We note that the process of making a regional economy more complex is likely to be associated with significant risks of failure, high expenditures and a slow pace of progress. Thus, a more developed higher education system potentially might have a small impact on the development of the corresponding regional economy. However, the latter does not imply that the process of balancing the quality of higher education in the Russian regions should be reversed. The further development of the network of high-quality regional universities contributes to the reduction of income inequality at the level of households by producing more favorable opportunities for migration to better developed regions and accessing higher-quality labor market segments.																			2221-2264						2020		2					187	197		10.31737/2221-2264-2020-46-2-11	http://dx.doi.org/10.31737/2221-2264-2020-46-2-11													WOS:000576644100011
J	Kumar, S; Singh, B				Kumar, Sanjesh; Singh, Baljeet			Barriers to the international diffusion of technological innovations	ECONOMIC MODELLING					2nd Energy Finance Conference	2019	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA					This paper examines the role of diffusion barriers in explaining differences in technological innovation across countries through an index of economic complexity. The barriers are captured by genealogical distance from the world's technology frontier. We hypothesize that greater the genetic distance between a country's population and the technology innovator the lower will be levels of technological innovations. Utilizing data for 100 countries, our empirical estimates offer solid support for the negative influence of genetic distance from the global frontier on innovation. A number of sensitivity checks also confirm that our findings are robust. Overall, the evidence lends strong support to the barriers effect of genetic distance from the frontier whereby it prevents the diffusion of productivity enhancing innovations across countries by affecting the country's capability to imitate and adopt frontier innovations and technologies.

To find important words in a text, we use a new approach based on word relatedness. We use two text relatedness methods: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Google Trigram Model (GTM) on five different datasets where words in the text-pair are sorted based on importance. We compare the use of a small number of important words against the use of all the words in the texts, and we find that both LSA and GTM achieve better results on four of the data sets and the same result on the fifth dataset.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES-REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES DU DEVELOPPEMENT												The importance of governance in promoting economic growth and its crucial role in the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals have been largely discussed in the literature. Given the importance of governance and the desire of all nations to ameliorate the level of governance, a growing literature has engaged in understanding its determinants. This study attempts to contribute to this literature by examining, for the first time, the effect of economic complexity on governance using data from 32 African countries over the period from 2002 to 2019. We elaborate four governance indicators based on a principal component analysis. Results provide strong evidence of a positive relationship, suggesting that moving to higher levels of economic complexity leads to better governance performance. We identify human capital, foreign direct investment, and income inequality as some transmission channels through which economic complexity promotes governance. Based on these results, several policy implications are discussed. L'importance de la gouvernance dans le developpement de la croissance economique, ainsi que son role crucial dans la realisation d'autres Objectifs de Developpement Durable, ont ete longuement debattus dans le milieu academique. Ce role important qui lui est donne, ainsi que la volonte de toutes les nations d'ameliorer leur niveau de gouvernance, ont mene a un nombre croissant d'etudes ayant pour sujet la comprehension des determinants de la gouvernance. Dans cet article, nous contribuons a cette litterature en analysant, pour la premiere fois, les effets de la complexite economique sur la gouvernance dans 32 pays africains, en nous basant sur des donnees collectees entre 2002 et 2019. Au fil d'une analyse en composantes principales, nous degageons quatre indicateurs de gouvernance. Nos resultats indiquent l'existence d'une relation positive, suggerant ainsi que l'adoption de niveaux de complexite economique plus eleves mene a une meilleure performance de gouvernance. Nous identifions le capital humain, les investissements directs etrangers, et l'inegalite de revenus comme certains des canaux de transmission par le biais desquels la complexite economique stimule la gouvernance. En nous basant sur ces resultats, nous considerons les implications politiques de cette relation entre complexite economique et gouvernance.

The economic complexity and innovation of the observed economies are robustly linked to their economic growth. The goal of this article is to investigate the significance of economic complexity and innovation in encouraging economic growth in high-income and upper middle-income economies. Miscellaneous methodological measurement instruments have been applied towards exploring the linkages between the crucial variables of economic complexity, innovation, and economic growth. The empirical data necessary for conducting this exploration were accumulated from primary and auxiliary sources. Analysis of the observed economies was performed using the statistical software package SPSS 25. The exploration results reveal the essential determinants of economic complexity and innovation for economic growth in selected countries. The interrelated determinants supervised for enhancing innovation and growth are linked to synthesized indicators of economic complexity. Confirmation of the heterogeneity between essential variables and awareness of sensitivity is the foundation for the subsequent acceptance of convenient economic complexity indicators for improvement of the critical fields of national economies.

This study aims to provide evidence to support the hypothesis that economic complexity has a significant positive effect on regional growth and long-standing regional imbalances in Turkey prevent the eastern region from benefiting equally from the economic gains of rising complexity. Using annual export data from 2007 to 2020 we calculated economic fitness and economic complexity indexes for the provinces of Turkey. We demonstrate that both economic fitness and economic complexity indexes are important determinants of regional growth in Turkey.

Using ecological footprint as an indicator	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												The current decade has witnessed the rise of empirical research in the domain of ecological footprint which has become a major scholarly area among environmental researchers. However, many key factors determining ecological footprint have been inadequately dealt within the existing body of knowledge. The current research aims to explore the association between economic complexity, human capital, renewable energy generation, urbanization, economic growth, export quality, trade and ecological footprint for the top ten economic complex countries. This study applied panel data estimators, for instance, fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and the system-GMM long-run estimators from 1980 to 2017. The long-run estimates reveal that economic complexity, economic growth, export quality, trade and urbanization increase ecological footprint. Human capital and renewable energy generation help to mitigate ecological footprint. We conclude that investment in more renewable energy generation and its consumption and efficient use of human capital will improve economic complexity, export quality, and environment in developed and developing countries.

Distinguishing between stable ties (present in all sub-periods) and non-stable ties (e.g. emerging, disappearing, etc.), we demonstrate that inter-industry relatedness linkages change considerably over time. Furthermore, we show that these changes matter for how the co-location of related industries (related variety) influences regional employment growth - to generate growth the type of local related ties should match with the regional setting. We suggest that, at least partly, the impact of emerging, stable and disappearing ties differs since complementarity potential between related industries becomes depleted over time. In other words, relatedness linkages have a 'best before date'.

Our task is forecasting of the emergence of new strong sectors in the region. On the basis of probabilistic and statistical modeling the model which allows estimating the probability of appearing a new strong sector in the region taking into account characteristics of economic structure is constructed. The possibility of building such a model is based on the assumption that the emergence and development of sectors is largely determined by the evolution of past economic activity. The authors introduce a model where the indicators of embedding structures of the strong sectors in the regional economies are used. These indicators are based on the probabilistic interpretation and properties of the elements of the matrix, by which economic complexity is estimated following the traditional approach. The probability of originating a strong sector in the structure for each region is estimated. Based on sorting the sectors according to the value of these probabilities and assessments of their potential contribution to socio-economic development expert assessment of the feasibility of developing a new strong sector in the region can be made. The results show that sectors' introduction and generation in the regional economy is largely due to the evolution of the past economic activity.

A stochastic convergence methodology was used, and the contrasts of the hypothesis were carried out through standard unit root tests and with structural break. The results show that the dispersion of complexity between countries increased steadily. In addition, these do not reveal absolute convergence, except for Costa Rica and Mexico, while other countries share common trends or present diver-gence compared to the reference countries. These findings imply that some economic problems, such as slow growth or levels of economic development, could not be solved if the systemic interactions at the productive level, revealed in the degree of economic complexity, do not improve. One of the limitations of the study is that it does not explicitly contem-plate the relationship with other dimensions of sustainable development.																			2248-6046	2011-7663				JUL-DEC	2022	14	2					313	350		10.14718/revfinanzpolitecon.v14.n2.2022.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.14718/revfinanzpolitecon.v14.n2.2022.2													WOS:000903955600002

One of the important contributions of this research is to explore the role of overall structural change and economic factors for renewable and cleaner energy in developed and emerging economies. The existing literature points to scant research about the impacts of economic complexity on energy transformation and renewable energy adoption. During recent years, the G7 and E7 countries have encountered enormous competition in manufacturing and industrialization and are also experiencing global pressure from both climate change and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the promotion of renewable energy infrastructure. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of issues, the authors apply the Westerlund cointegration and heterogeneous panel data techniques (FGLS, system GMM, FMOLS, and DOLS) for an in-depth, empirical analysis. Interestingly, empirical findings indicate that economic complexity affects renewable energy demand from G7 and E7 countries. This paper documents that economic complexity is a policy factor for overall energy transformation and greener energy demand. This study recommends that complexity and structural change policies should be observed for cleaner and greener growth and overall greener energy promotion.

The ideology and thus behavior of interest groups cannot be isolated from history, customs, economic conditions and changing alternatives open to individuals. In Australia, there were historical and traditional divisions concerning farmers producing for international markets that depend on flexible world prices and those producing for the domestic market with stabilized and subsidized prices. The National Farmers Federation (NFF) (1979) is the result of a historical-evolutionary-developmental process of preceding agricultural interest groups. Hence, an understanding of the NFF ideology that promotes free competition and the elimination of agricultural subsidies worldwide, in contrast to the agricultural interest groups in the United States and UK, requires an examination, using an institutional and economic complexity approach, of the evolution of agricultural interest groups in Australia.

Economic complexity and the environment: some estimates on their links	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATICS												The concept of economic complexity and the relevant economic complexity index (ECI) have been introduced in the theory and empirics of economic growth. As a consequence, the literature on economic complexity covers its relationship with several factors related to growth including environmental implications. Using traditional non-parametric statistics methods, the study investigates again the relationship between economic complexity and per capita incomes, and the relationship between economic complexity and the environment. Environmental variables used are the environmental performance index (EPI), the per capita ecological footprint of consumption, EFpcc and the per capita ecological footprint of production, EFpcp. The relationships are studied for a large set of economies as a whole, and for countries of two different levels of development, as measured by the human development index (HDI). Results confirm the positive relationship between per capita incomes and economic complexity while those with regards to environmental implications depend on the environmental index chosen and the level of development. Economic complexity is positively associated with the strain on the environment shown by the ecological footprints, but positively associated also with the environmental performance of policies given by the EPI.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Energy insecurity and unsustainable development associated with traditional energy consumption are major challenges for nations. In this context, finding the different parameters that could influence energy use is essential for sustainable development strategies. Unquestionably, the economic structure of nations can influence energy usage; however, the limited literature on this topic delved into the impact of economic complexity on non-renewable energy usage. Hence, this study extends the literature and tests the effect of knowledge-based economic structure (economic complexity) on renewable and non-renewable energy consumption in 14 European Union countries from 1990 to 2017 using the methods robust against both heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The long-run empirical results established that economic complexity increases renewable energy and decreases non-renewable energy use. Also, economic complexity Granger causes non-renewable energy while feedback effect exists between renewable energy and economic complexity. Based on the results, policies are discussed for promoting sustainable growth.

How to make economic complexity index more complex: Taking export geography into account	ZHURNAL NOVAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA-JOURNAL OF THE NEW ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION												In this study, we develop a new approach to redefine the economic complexity index (see (Hausmann et al., 2011) for the original method). ECI is a relative measure, which evaluates the progress in the structural transformation of a particular economy. While constructing the new index, we not only take into account how complex two economic structures are, which is reflected in the composition of their export baskets, but also how productive are these structures, which is mirrored in the geographical structures of their exports. Countries with more complex economic structures, still export more complex products, while more productive economies export their products to a large variety of markets, including rich economies. We find that some economies, which the traditional approach, by ignoring the fact that most of their exports go to the not-so-rich markets of their geographical neighbors, overestimates by providing a too high position in the ranking, take significantly lower position after the new approach is applied. This result is more consistent with these economies' recent years' growth rates.

The results indicated that, in addition to its ecological benefits, economic complexity can effectively decouple environmental sustainability from both EF2-D and EF3-D in GCC countries. Additionally, empirical findings supported an inverse U-shaped relationship between both the three-dimensional and traditional ecological footprints and economic growth at all quantiles. Moreover, population and fossil fuel energy were found to have a positive effect on EF2-D and EF3-D in GCC countries. Based on these findings, policymakers are advised to propose comprehensive policies that target not just the size but also the depth of ecological footprints.

J	Zhu, SJ; Li, RY				Zhu, Shujin; Li, Renyu			Economic complexity, human capital and economic growth: empirical research based on cross-country panel data	APPLIED ECONOMICS												Economic complexity reflects a country's production capabilities and plays an important role in economic growth. This article measures the economic complexity of 210 countries using the method of reflections, and investigates the impact of economic complexity and human capital on economic growth. The measurement results show that there are significant differences regarding the level of complexity among countries. High-income economies have higher complexity than low- and middle-income economies. The empirical findings demonstrate that economic complexity and different levels of human capital have positive effects on long- and short-term growth. A positive interaction effect on economic growth exists between economic complexity and human capital. In addition, secondary education as a proxy for human capital has a relatively greater positive direct effect and a much stronger interactive effect with complexity on economic growth. In addition, the magnitude of the interaction effect between economic complexity and human capital on long- and short-term growth increases as the revealed comparative advantage threshold grows.					zhu, shujin/JAC-2691-2023														0003-6846	1466-4283					2017	49	38					3815	3828		10.1080/00036846.2016.1270413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2016.1270413													WOS:000401999100003
J	Demir, F				Demir, Firat			IMF conditionality, export structure and economic complexity:The ineffectiveness of structural adjustment programs	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS												The conditionality requirements of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been a source of intense debate since the early 1980s. These conditions, which are attached to IMF lending programs, cover a variety of issues from fiscal and monetary reform to economic liberalization and institutional change. In this paper we empirically examined the effects of IMF programs and conditionality requirements on structural transformation through changes in the technology-andskill intensity and overall economic complexity of exports. Our empirical methodology accounted for policy and conditionality heterogeneity across country and time and accounts for the endogeneity of IMF programs and conditions. The empirical results suggest that IMF programs and conditionality requirements along a spectrum of policy areas had no robust or significant effect on export structure, economic complexity or export diversification. Overall, we found no evidence of any positive effects of IMF programs or IMF conditionality requirements on the technology-andskill intensity of exports.

By utilising a global sample of 86 countries over the period 2002-2017 and applying several econometric techniques, we find that financial institutions and financial markets, as well as their sub-indices (financial depth, financial access and financial efficiency), have significantly positive impacts on economic complexity. Interestingly, financial institutions have a stronger effect than financial markets, and it is the same with financial efficiency over financial access and financial depth. Three subsamples comprising 28 low- and lower-middle-income countries, 22 upper-middle-income countries and 36 high-income countries are examined.

It is a well known problem with applications ranging from computational linguistics to cognitive psychology. In all existing approaches, relatedness is assumed to be symmetric i.e. the relatedness of terms t(i) and term t(j) is considered the same as the relatedness of terms tj and ti. However, there are tasks such as free word association, where the association strength assumed to be asymmetric. In free word association, the given term determines the context in which the association strength must be computed. Based on this key observation, the paper presents a new approach to computing term relatedness guided by asymmetric association. The focus of this paper is on using Wikipedia for extracting directional context of each given term and computing the association of input term pair in this context. The proposed approach is generic enough to deal with both symmetric as well as asymmetric relatedness computation problems. Empirical evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets shows encouraging results when our automatically computed relatedness scores are correlated with human judgments.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-642-41230-1; 978-3-642-41229-5				2013	8180						92	101																WOS:000342806000008

Evidence from BRICS nations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT												PurposeThis paper aims to assess the moderating role of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the effect of economic complexity on carbon emissions, considering other drivers of carbon emissions such as renewable energy use and economic growth, using data set spanning between 1990 and 2018 in BRICS nations. Design/methodology/approachThis research aims to fill the gap in ongoing literature. Cross-sectional IPS and cross-sectional augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, fully modified ordinary least square, dynamic ordinary least square, fixed effect ordinary least square, Westerlund cointegration and method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) econometric approaches are applied. FindingsThe Westerlund cointegration outcomes disclosed long-run interconnectedness between carbon emissions and its drivers. Furthermore, MMQR outcomes disclosed that in each tail (0.1-0.90), economic growth and economic complexity contribute to upsurge in carbon emissions while in each quantile (0.1-0.90) renewable energy abate carbon emissions. Furthermore, we affirmed the pollution-haven and environmental Kuznets curve hypotheses across all quantiles (0.1-0.90). Finally, at all quantiles (0.1-0.90), the joint effect of both FDI inflows and economic complexity reduced carbon emissions. Furthermore, the panel causality outcomes disclosed that all the exogenous variables can predict carbon emissions. Based on the findings, BRICS nation's policymakers should place a greater emphasis on FDI inflows because it aids in abating environmental degradation. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first research to test the moderating role of FDI on the effect of economic complexity on carbon emissions. Hence, this research aims to fill the gap in ongoing literature.

The economic complexity of US metropolitan areas	REGIONAL STUDIES												We calculate measures of economic complexity for US metropolitan areas for the period 1998-2015 based on employment data. We show that the concept translates well to the regional setting and to local and traded industries. Large cities and the Northeast have the highest complexity, while most traded industries are more complex than most local ones. In cross-section, metropolitan complexity is associated with higher incomes, though to a lesser extent recently than in the past. However, within-city increases in complexity from year to year are associated with income decreases.

J	Hu, YM; Fan, ZC; Lin, JY; Xu, MZ				Hu, Yumin; Fan, Zhongchen; Yifu Lin, Justin; Xu, Mingzhi (Jimmy)			A reasoning of economic complexity based on simulated general equilibrium international trade model	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY												By simulating a multi-country general equilibrium international trade model, we investigate how the economic complexity index (ECI) and fitness index (FI) are related directly to economic fundamentals with a clear basis in theory. The model is based on Eaton and Kortum (2002 Econometrica 70 1741-79) and combines factor endowment (Heckscher-Ohlin) and technological (Ricardian) reasons for specialization, which further determines economic complexity across countries. First, we find that FI performs better than ECI in explaining the real-world specialization pattern, where successful countries not only produce complex products due to the comparative advantage but also tend to produce a wide range of possible products due to the absolute advantage. Second, we highlight that the predictive power of various economic complexity measures for income is crucially sensitive to other factors that shift marginal cost from its efficient level in manufacturing sectors. The essence of such an issue lies in the assumption that the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) correctly reflects a country's real capability of specialization across different goods. However, there would exist a gap between the core idea of learning the national complexity from RCA and the fact that the revealed specialization pattern in data may not necessarily suggest a country's actual capability in the presence of distortions, the latter of which is ubiquitous across developing countries.																				2632-072X				SEP 1	2023	4	3							035003	10.1088/2632-072X/ace39e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-072X/ace39e													WOS:001036266100001

Do international tourism arrivals, infrastructural development, and trade openness promote economic complexity in Africa?	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT												Recent scholarly articles consistently show that economic complexity promotes economic development. However, upon further examination of the literature, it becomes evident that macroeconomic determinants of economic complexity are not fully investigated, particularly in Africa. This study addressed this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of international tourism arrivals, infrastructural development, and trade openness on economic complexity in Africa. The study utilized the dynamic system GMM and panel Fixed Effects estimators for 34 African economies from 2010 to 2021. The results indicated that international tourism arrival and trade openness have beneficial effects on economic complexity in Africa, while the effects of infrastructural development remained mainly negative. Additionally, we established that human capital development and foreign direct investment inflow are potent channels for promoting economic complexity on the continent. We highlighted the policy implications of these findings.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY												Today, many countries in the world pay special attention to energy efficiency to improve environmental quality and reduce the waste of energy resources. For this purpose, this research has investigated the economic complexity of energy intensity (EI) from 1995 to 2019 using club convergence and panel quantile regression (PQR) models. The club convergence results showed that out of 62 countries, 42 converged in energy intensity during the period. Then, using the PQR model, the determining factors of EI for these 42 countries were evaluated: economic complexity, urbanization, trade openness, industrial production, foreign direct investment, oil price, and economic growth. The result of the PQR model confirmed that economic complexity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with EI. Urbanization and foreign direct investment have a positive and increasing effect on EI. In addition, trade openness positively affects EI, mainly in the 10th and 25th quantiles. On the other hand, economic growth has a decreasing effect on EI. Moreover, industrialization and oil prices can reduce EI, particularly in the 90th quantile. Given the inverted U-shaped effect of the energy complexity on energy intensity, where the lower and higher quantiles are negative, it is advised that policymakers ought to promote the leap from lower levels of economic complexity to higher levels by reducing intermediate levels as much as possible. Policymakers should also be conscious that promoting the diffusion of economic complexity also mitigates noxious gas emissions.

Empirical evidence	STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS												Upgrading the production capabilities in all countries is a target of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goal 9. Increasing economic complexity, that is, a country's ability to manufacture more sophisticated products and thus moving up the value chain, is a key driver for sustainable economic growth. This paper investigates whether Chinese Belt and Road investments have impacted the economic complexity of host countries - a topic not addressed in the literature to date, using a sequential generalised method of moments model selection approach. The research focuses on the countries whose economic complexities are below that of China. Our empirical results show significant positive effects of Chinese investments on such host countries' economic complexities. The inflows of Chinese investments have thus supported the upgrading of production capabilities in these countries. This is encouraging, especially for the Global South countries, to intensify their interactions with the Belt and Road initiative.

By applying diverse econometric techniques to a global sample of 42 low-income & lower-middle-income (LI&LMICs) and 30 upper-middle-income (UMICs) and 38 high-income (HICs) during the 2002-2017 period, our findings confirm the presence of a non-linear association between economic complexity outlook index and the shadow economy while economic complexity index has an increasingly significant and negative influence on shadow economy. Furthermore, a non-linear relationship between economic complexity and the shadow economy more likely exists either in the long run or in the high-income economy. Notably, we find that economic complexity plays a critical role in deteriorating the positive effects of uncertainty on the size of the shadow economy, while institutional quality significantly determines the effect of economic complexity.

RENEWABLE ENERGY												The severe environmental degradation and huge energy demand for economic growth necessitate an urgent shift to a cleaner and more efficient energy system. Using data from 32 high-income countries from 2000 to 2020, the study highlights the important roles of green financial policy, environmental tax, economic complexity, and globalization in the energy transition. Green financial policy, environmental tax, and globalization are found to exert beneficial impacts at the selected quantiles of the energy transition distribution. Meanwhile, the quantile regression reveals a U-shaped impact of economic complexity in the first half distribution of the energy transition while an inverted U-shaped linkage is discovered in the second half distribution. This paper is unique in the intention of studying the varying co-benefits of four important factors, which provide valuable insights into the existing literature on the finance-socioeconomic-energy nexus. They facilitate the design and implementation of relevant schemes leading to the accomplishment of environmental sustainable goals.

J	Inoua, S				Inoua, Sabiou			A simple measure of economic complexity	RESEARCH POLICY												Contrary to conventional economic growth theory, which reduces a country's output to one aggregate variable (GDP), product diversity is central to economic development, as recent "economic complexity" research suggests. A country's product diversity reflects its diversity of knowhow or "capabilities". Researchers proposed the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and the country Fitness index to estimate a country's number of capabilities from international export data; these measures predict economic growth better than conventional variables such as human capital. This paper offers a simpler measure of a country's knowhow, Log Product Diversity (or LPD, the logarithm of a country's number of products), which can be derived from a one-parameter combinatorial model of production in which a set of knowhows combine with some probability to turn raw materials into a product. ECI and log-fitness can be interpreted theoretically (using the combinatorial model) and empirically as potentially noisy estimates of LPD; moreover, controlling for natural resources, the simple measure better ex-plains the cross-country differences in GDP and in GDP per capita.																			0048-7333	1873-7625				SEP	2023	52	7							104793	10.1016/j.respol.2023.104793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104793		MAY 2023											WOS:001010859800001

However, given the uniqueness of many economies i.e., partnerships investment in energy and economic complexity around the globe, it is imperative to investigate the nexus between the outlined variables in a carbon-income framework. To this end, we leverage on second-generational panel methods for its superiority over first-generation model over annual frequency data from 1990 to 2018 for the case of BRICS countries. Empirical findings show that positive changes in trade openness and economic complexity stimulate environmental quality. On the contrary, economic growth, natural resources and public-private partnership contribute to environmental degradation. Based on these results, new insights are obtained for the policymakers, and policies are recommended to develop the environmental quality in BRICS economies.

J	Sanli, D; Yigiteli, NG				Sanli, Devran; Yigiteli, Nadide Gulbay			Do economic complexity and macroeconomic stability asymmetrically affect carbon emissions in OECD? Evidence from nonlinear panel ARDL approach	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												This study examines the asymmetric effect of economic complexity and macroeconomic stability on carbon emissions for OECD countries over the period between 1995 and 2020. We construct a nonlinear panel ARDL-PMG model to assess the short- and long-run impact of the positive and negative shifts of economic complexity and macroeconomic stability on carbon emissions. The asymmetric findings prove that macroeconomic stability and instability positively impact carbon emissions in the long run. Moreover, asymmetric economic complexity shocks increase pollution in the long run. The impact of short-run shocks on carbon emissions returns to long-run equilibrium in 2.75 years (33 months) with an annual correction of 36.4%. One of the most striking findings of this study is that the sophisticated, complex production structure may pollute the environment less than traditional production. However, it still increases environmental degradation in absolute terms. Therefore, economic complexity only slows the rate of increase in environmental pollution. Capital stock and institutional quality have a weaker effect on emissions, while openness does not.

This is probably the first research to explore the role of economic complexity for environmental quality, in the objective to report new solutions for climate change issues. More specifically, the study investigates the linear and asymmetric impacts of economic complexity and fossil fuel energy use on ecological footprint by using the extensive data spanning the period of 1965Q1 to 2017Q4. For empirical analysis, the authors employ the newly developed quantile unit root test, quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL), and quantile Granger causality tests. The quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) analysis confirmed that economic complexity and fossil fuel energy consumption significantly enhance the ecological footprint in the United States. Further, the quantile causality empirics suggested the existence of causal relationships between economic complexity and energy consumption with the ecological footprint. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The model uses bipartite network representation for the economy's structures presented in the paper (Hausmann, Hidalgo, Bustos, Coscia, Simoes, Yildirim, 2011). For the considered network representation, it is given the probabilistic interpretation and described some theoretical properties. Also, it is presented the procedure for filtering the network structure from randomness, which improves the model's quality. As an example of the model implementation, for each region of Russia, it is estimated the probability of a specific sector's appearance as a strong one in its economy's structure. Using the estimated probabilities, a list of sectors recommended for priority development in a region has been compiled. Based on the list of recommended sectors, groups of adjacent sectors have been formed. Also, it is studied the empirical relationships between characteristics of the considered network representation for structures of the Russian region's economies and some factors of socioeconomic development factors including economic complexity.

J	Gaglio, C				Gaglio, Cyrielle			Trade Liberalization and Export Performance: A Literature Review	REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE												In a context of trade liberalization, this article reviews the most recent economic literature related to the sources of countries' export performance. In such a context, world trade flows and international competition increase. International trade evolves in favor of large emerging countries, they quickly penetrate the world market and specialize in high-sophisticated products. Furthermore, emerging countries have expanding their exports much faster than the leading developed countries. The reshaping of the world market depends on these emerging countries. These findings lead us to study the sources of countries' export performance. On the one hand, this literature review presents the traditional measures of countries' export performance focusing on export diversification. These measures suggest that diversification goes hand-in-hand with countries' growth and economic development. On the other hand, this literature review details the new measures of countries' export performance related to export sophistication, product space, and economic complexity. These measures converge towards specialized diversification, i.e. a diversification into related products which generates new activities that are rooted in a country's initial patterns of specialization. Therefore, the process of specialized diversification focuses on countries' structural transformation in order to become more complex economies.																			0373-2630					JAN-FEB	2017	127	1					25	46																WOS:000400881800002

These indexes have been frequently used in the economic geography and economic development literature for the optimal design of industrial strategies. In the original study, these authors calculated these measures for countries and products using data on the value of their exports. Since then, various studies have estimated them at the subnational level using other variables such as: employment, patents, technologies, salaries, etc. This article presents a proposal for a more periodic and robust estimation of the indices in Mexico using a different variable, the number of establishments or economic units by type of activity, this variable is obtained from the National Statistical Directory of Economic Units (DENUE, its Spanish acronym). The results are consistent, both for municipalities and for industries, and present a better fit compared to those of previous studies. We consider that our proposal is pertinent because it allows for the design and more periodic evaluation of industrial strategies and subnational public policies in the area of economic development.																			1695-7253	2340-2717					2024		59								10.38191/iirr-jorr.24.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.38191/iirr-jorr.24.018													WOS:001204032000003

Economic Complexity, Economic Growth, and CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions: A Panel Data Analysis	INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC JOURNAL												Reducing global warming effects without jeopardizing economic prosperity demands the analysis of the link between these factors. Environmental degradation and economic growth are thought to be related in a non-linear manner, following an inverted-U pattern called the 'Environmental Kuznets Curve' (EKC). Despite the many studies seeking empirical support for this relationship, the literature does not provide conclusive findings. By presenting the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) as an explanatory variable, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive analysis of EKC from 86 countries with different development levels, covering the period between 1971 and 2014. Different statistical estimation techniques were used, including an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model, dynamic panel data techniques, and the Sasabuchi-Lind-Mehlum (SLM) test. The results show no clear evidence supporting the idea of EKC, neither for production volumes nor for production sophistication, as captured by ECI. Nonetheless, when ECI increases, pollution levels drop monotonously only for developed countries.

However, technological innovations (TI) and remittances, among the financial system's essential components, are relatively ignored. In addition, nations' economic progress and environmental performance also depend upon the nature of their economic structure. This empirical research investigates the effects of TI, remittances and economic complexity (EC) on CO2 controlling economic growth and trade openness (TR) in the selected 15 Asian nations. The study collected panel data of 15 Asian countries from 1990 to 2019 and employed the panel quantile regression and augmented mean group methods to unveil the impacts of variables on CO2 emissions. The empirical findings established that remittances are negatively linked with CO2 emissions. Similarly, EC reduces CO2 emissions in the context of Asian countries. In addition, EC and remittances Granger cause CO2 emissions. These findings indicate that remittances and EC positively contribute to environmental quality in Asian countries. Conversely, TI, economic growth, and TR intensify CO2 emissions in Asian countries. Finally, the study recommended policies to enhance remittances and EC in Asian countries to curb environmental degradation.

Performance and business relatedness as drivers of exit decision: A study of MNCs from an emerging country	GLOBAL STRATEGY JOURNAL												This study examines the exit behavior of emerging market MNCs in the context of the parent company (PC)-foreign affiliate (FA) relationship. Specifically, we consider business relatedness as a moderating variable and examine its impact on the relationship between an FA's international performance and its exit decision from a foreign market. Our results, based on data collected from multiple informants in 180 Chinese firms, indicate that product relatedness and intangible resource relatedness have different moderating impacts on the FA performance-FA exit decision relationship. Implications of these findings, along with the limitations of the study, are discussed. Although the research on international entry and expansion is particularly important, an aspect that has been largely ignored in the literature is the exit behavior of firms. This study examines whether the extent to which a foreign subsidiary is similar to its parent's core business may influence the firm's exit decision. The findings indicate that managers are more likely to exit a poorly performing FA if there is a high (vs. low) level of product relatedness between the FA and its PC's core business. The results also suggest that intangible resource relatedness exerts a different contingent effect on the FA performance-FA exit relationship than does product relatedness.					tan, qun/O-8655-2019	Sousa, Carlos M.

This article suggests that the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) can capture this 'resilience dimension' of complex economies and assesses their contribution to sustainable change through the amalgamation of export and import information. This novel methodological approach incorporates import information by applying amalgamation on a pre S-Level, which is based on the Lie-Trotter methodology, inducing a Random Walk on a Graph. In the empirical part, this procedure is examined. It shows that the ECI ranking may not always reflect the underlying internal economic complexity of a country, and with it, the country's resilience and contribution to sustainable change. The novel approach is to some extent comparable with the degree of eligibility criteria of the original ECI and consistent with the organic evolutionary character of complex economies. After translating the ECI framework into its stochastic counterpart, the proofs of its interpretation in statistic and probabilistic terms, and its relationship to the Shannon Entropy are conducted. Coherency conditions of sustainability as further eligibility criteria are formulated and the degree of coherency of the ECI is investigated. In view of the challenges related to data preparation, we suggest applying the approach to a broader set of data including import information in order to gain additional insights in a country's internal economic complexity and resilience.

We present an empirical study of these measures on a large, real data set containing 2,996 vocabularies, and 15 million RDF documents that use them. Then, we propose to apply vocabulary relatedness to the problem of post-selection vocabulary recommendation.

We use the impulse-response function (IRF) computed from the consistent generalized method of moment panel vector autoregressive (GMM pVAR) model to estimate the response of the real output growth to a change in the economic complexity index. The IRF shows that the economic complexity index has a significant impact on economic growth; a 1 standard deviation shock to the economic complexity index at time 0 contributes around 2.34 percentage points to the average rate of growth of output within the first period. The point estimates are positive and significant up to the third period. The cumulative IRF shows that the aggregate impact on economic growth is about 4.4% in the long run. Compared to some widely used innovation proxies such as the gross expenditure on research and development and secondary school enrollment, the economic complexity index performs relatively better in our model in determining economic growth in the long run.

J	Azam, S				Azam, Sardor			A cross-country empirical test of cognitive abilities and innovation nexus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT												In this study we analyze the relationship between national cognitive abilities and innovational output using data from 124 countries of the world. By employing cross-country IQ scores traditionally used by psychological literature to represent national intelligence, and Economic Complexity Index as a novel measure of innovation, our study shows that there is a positive connection between them. We use a variety of tests to check the robustness of the nexus. Overall, our findings indicate that more intelligent nations export more sophisticated and diverse products to the world market and thus are more innovative. Therefore, developing countries should consider investing in human capital and related institutions if they are to boost innovative capabilities and move up the technology ladder in producing and exporting sophisticated and varied lines of products. This should bring them greater economic diversity which could be a right lever in mitigating negative external shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, studies tend to treat relatedness as being time-invariant or, alternatively, consider its evolution as exogenously given. This study argues that relatedness is inherently dynamic and endogenous to technological and economic developments. Using patent data, we test the extent to which relatedness between technologies developed along co-location and differences in technological complexity in 1980-2010. Our results show that co-located technologies are more likely to become related over time. Moreover, our results suggest that co-location and complexity of technologies are conducive to the intensification of relatedness over time.

The two-step system GMM estimation is employed to capture the non-linear relationships among interested variables. The findings indicate that income disparity is significantly and non-linearly linked with economic complexity and gray economy. First, there exists a U-shaped relationship between economic complexity and income disparity. The turning point for which the effect of economic complexity on income inequality changes from negative to positive is -0.732. Second, the impact of the shadow economy on income inequality displays an inverted U-shaped pattern. The estimated threshold above which the marginal effect of the shadow economy on income inequality changes from positive to negative equals 15.6%. Given the complications of these relationships, the governments are advised to take into consideration the situation of these two socio-economic issues when developing income distribution-related policies.

We also show that we can improve accuracy by intelligent selection of path corpora based on path characteristics indicating that not all paths are equally useful. Our work makes an argument for expanding the existing arsenal of data sources for calculating semantic relatedness and to consider the utility of human navigational paths for this task.

So measuring the concept relatedness efficiently is an important task. Previous studies rarely distinguish between relatedness and similarity; they usually use a common formula. We suggest that concept relatedness consists of similarity and relevance, which should be computed differently. In this paper, we first give a similarity measure based on path length, taxonomy depth, and different relations between concepts. Then we propose a method to measure the specific association relation besides basic relations. Finally, incorporating both similarity and specific relevance, we get an overall formula of computing concept relatedness. Compared to existing methods, our measure of concept relatedness is more consistent with human judgment.

J	Nesta, L				Nesta, Lionel			Knowledge and productivity in the world's largest manufacturing corporations	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION												w This paper develops a model I inking firm knowledge with productivity. The model captures three characteristics of firm knowledge (capital, diversity and relatedness) that are tested on a sample of 156 of the world's largest corporations. Panel data regression models suggest that unlike knowledge diversity, knowledge capital and knowledge relatedness explain a substantial share of the variance of firm productivity. Relatedness matters because it lowers coordination costs between heterogeneous activities. Consequently, the traditional econometric specification has repeatedly underestimated by 15 percent the overall short-run contribution of intangible assets to firm productivity. This underestimation becomes fiercer in high-technology sectors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In many cases, entity relatedness is highly affected by dynamic contexts, which can be reflected in the outcome of different applications. However, the role of context is largely unexplored in existing entity relatedness measures. In this paper, we introduce the notion of contextual entity relatedness, and show its usefulness in the new yet important problem of context-aware entity recommendation. We propose a novel method of computing the contextual relatedness with integrated time and topic models. By exploiting an entity graph and enriching it with an entity embedding method, we show that our proposed relatedness can effectively recommend entities, taking contexts into account. We conduct large-scale experiments on a real-world data set, and the results show considerable improvements of our solution over the states of the art.

Previous studies have suggested that economic growth, facilitated by economic complexity and globalization, plays a significant role in poor environmental quality. Therefore, this study aims to examine the dynamic interplay between environmental quality, economic globalization, and economic complexity in the OECD economies from 1970 to 2015. Additionally, the study investigates the influence of control variables such as institutional quality, industrialization and energy consumption on CO2 emissions and emission intensity, using panel dynamic generalized method of moment (GMM) and bootstrapping quantile regression model. The stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) framework were employed to establish the relationships. The findings show that economic globalization and economic complexity can enhance environmental quality by reducing CO2 emissions and emission intensity globally. Economic globalization reduces the impact of CO2 emissions in the lower and upper quantile groups, while significantly increasing in the middle quantile group. Moreover, the study supports the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Better institutional quality and eco-friendly industries are potential policy suggestions for reducing the ecological footprint in developed economies.

J	Nan, SJ; Huo, YC; You, WH; Guo, YW				Nan, Shijing; Huo, Yuchen; You, Wanhai; Guo, Yawei			Globalization spatial spillover effects and carbon emissions: What is the role of economic complexity?	ENERGY ECONOMICS												This paper employs the spatial panel model to explore the interaction between globalization and economic complexity on CO2 emissions. To capture different potential mechanisms of diffusions, this paper builds hybrid W matrices based on trade distance and geographical distances. Further, to reduce small sample bias and capture "true interactions" across countries, the multiple imputation algorithm is used to address missingness pattern. This approach can efficiently enhance data quality and inferences validity. Furthermore, to distinguish the spatial spillover accurately, cross-sectional averages are used to solve the issue caused by the omission of common factors or shocks that affect differently the different spatial units. Results show that there is a positive spatial spillover of CO2 emissions from neighboring countries to the local country. Furthermore, the results show that globalization on its own has no significant effect on CO2 emissions in the local country but decreases CO2 emissions in neighboring countries. More importantly, when taking economic complexity into account, high level of economic complexity may decrease the negative indirect impact of globalization on carbon emissions. The more complex countries are to the economic structure, the less is the negative impact of globalization on carbon emissions in spatially related countries. These findings highlight that the role of economic complexity and spatial spillovers effects are imperative to be considered. Based on this study, several policy recommendations are provided.																			0140-9883	1873-6181				AUG	2022	112								106184	10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106184		JUL 2022											WOS:000883603400008

The current study attempts to report a comprehensive analysis of biomass energy and economic complexity on ecological and carbon footprints and carbon emissions. We employ data from 1990 to 2019 and adopt robust panel econometric techniques that account for the analysis's cross-sectional dependence. We conduct cointegration analysis, pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), system generalized method of moments (GMM) and conditional quantile model for our empirical analysis. The empirical findings show that both biomass energy consumption and economic complexity are detrimental to the ecological footprint and carbon footprint. Additionally, we find that globalization positively affects the environment, while we find some evidence that bureaucratic quality improves environmental quality. Finally, in line with other research, we find that economic growth has detrimental effects on the environment. Our results suggest that policymakers should be more cautious in promoting biomass as a clean energy source and that the G7 economies should take advantage of their leading position in innovation to invest more in sustainable practices and investment.

To this end, the current study attempts to address the impact of the economic complexity on environmental quality in the presence of renewable energy consumption, financial development, urbanization and energy innovation in RCEP countries from 1990 to 2019. Our empirical estimates confirm a significant association between environmental quality, economic complexity index, renewable energy consumption, financial development, urbanization and energy innovation in the short-run and long run. Based on extensive econometric analysis (CS-ARDL, AMG, PMG, FMOLS, and DOLS), we conclude that economic complexity, renewable energy, and energy innovation effectively mitigate environmental degradation. At the same time, financial development and urbanization have an adverse impact on the environment. These findings have extensive policy implications for policymakers and environmental stakeholders, who are aiming to achieve sustainable energy policy and economic growth to meet the environmental commitments under Paris Climate Agreement.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) estimator is applied for empirical analysis. The empirical evidence reveals the association between economic complexity and CO2 emissions is inverted-U and further N-shaped relationship. This confirms the presence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypotheses in the region. The empirical results also authenticate the pollution haven hypothesis since high FDI is the culprit to increase environmental degradation in the PIIGS economies. The participation of renewable energy is found to inhibit CO2 emissions. Urbanization process exerts huge pressure on environmental quality. Finally, the findings of Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test explores a bidirectional causal link between economic complexity and CO2 emissions. These findings advocate policymakers to propose comprehensive energy and economic policies by targeting cleaner production exercises, not only for environmental quality but also to accomplish the objectives of 17 sustainable development goals targets.

It is widely believed that technological innovation and economic complexity are understood as structural transformations toward a more sophisticated and knowledge-based means of production as a viable way to fight against climate change. However, the studies integrating these two elements into the same environmental policy framework are still scant. With this in view, this study investigates the dynamic linkage between economic complexity, technological innovations, economic growth, and nonrenewable energy on CO2 emissions in the N-11 nations. This study uses data from 1980 to 2020. It applies the recent method of cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL). The cointegration method shows a strong association among the variables. The findings of the CS-ARDL show that technological innovations are negatively related to environmental degradation, while nonrenewable energy deteriorates the environment by escalating CO2 emissions. This study fails to validate the EKC in the N-11 nations. In addition, economic complexity is helping these economies to achieve environmental sustainability by lowering environmental pollution. Based on the findings, this work recommends that the N-11 countries restructure their industrial sectors with low-carbon energy sources. For this purpose, these countries should increase their research and development budgets. This will help in launching environmentally friendly energy sources in their economic development model.

In particular, the study analyses the roles of human capital, Internet usage, and energy poverty in these relationships. The analysis is carried out for two indices of economic complexity (ECI and ECI+) in a sample of 40 selected developing countries from 2002 to 2017. Applying a two-step system generalised method of moments estimate to deal with endogeneity, and predictive margins analysis to analyse the catalytic role of basic resources, four interesting findings emerge. First, trade openness has a positive impact on economic complexity, while FDI inflows have a negative impact. Second, human capital accumulation accelerates the effect of trade openness but does not have a catalytic role in the effect of FDI inflows. Third, the development of the Internet is found to be a new and important resource that boosts the positive impact of trade openness and, notably, turns positive the negative impact of FDI inflows. Fourth, the role of energy poverty reduction is mostly the same as Internet development. The alleviation of energy poverty and Internet development seem to be good policies for enabling developing countries to absorb spillovers from economic integration.

J	Barker, J				Barker, Justin			Alone together: the strategies of autonomy and relatedness in the lives of homeless youth	JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES												This article proposes that the social lives of homeless young people are structured by two strategies: autonomy and relatedness. The strategy of autonomy is the prevailing modus operandi of homeless young people who respond to the uncertainty and instability of their lives with a defiant independence and self-reliance. However, their propensity to self-interested autonomy exacerbates a sense of isolation, alienation and loneliness, which leads to the strategy of relatedness. These strategies are responses to instability that take divergent, and even contradictory, approaches to dealing with the conditions of youth homelessness. There is a complex interaction between these two strategies, with homeless young people's social lives and the conditions of their lives structured by the seeming incompatibility of autonomy and relatedness. This article draws on ethnographic research and 12 months of participant observation to provide an understanding of the strategies of autonomy and relatedness as they pertain to the lives to homeless young people. The strategies of autonomy and relatedness capture the recurring themes and organising sentiments in the lives of homeless young people whilst still acknowledging the diverse, inventive and unlimited variety of practices enacted by this heterogeneous group of people.

This study provides evidence that this, in turn, altered the degree and nature of economic synchronization among them. Furthermore, it shows evidence of an increasingly significant positive relationship from 1994 on between economic synchronization and the level of sophistication of states' economic structures [measured by the Economic Complexity Index (ECI)]. As economic integration increases, it becomes easier for shocks to be transmitted between state economies with similar economic structures, either because their characteristics make them more sensitive to the same kinds of shocks or simply because they are so closely linked. Our results help provide a greater understanding of the states' economic evolution during the period analyzed.

J	Ben Saad, M				Ben Saad, Myriam			The Effect of Economic Complexity on Air Pollution: Another approach to the Environmental Curve of Kuznets	REGION ET DEVELOPPEMENT												The focus of this paper is to highlight, beyond the effect of GDP per capita, the major role of the evolution of structural transformations on the level of air pollution (CO2 emissions per capita), taking again the model of the Kuznets environmental curve and estimating it on a sample of 133 countries from 1984 to 2014. The influence of structural changes on pollution is evaluated in an original way by an index of economic complexity (ICE). The relative decline in pollution from a certain threshold, particularly noticeable in high-income countries, is more a result of far-reaching structural changes than of development, although there may be some link between them. Thus, the increase in economic complexity makes it possible more quickly to reach the threshold of reversal of the level of pollution than the increase in GDP per capita. This result suggests that to reduce pollution, growth patterns and productive specializations are more important than growth itself and the level of economic development achieved.																			1267-5059	2117-0843					2017		46					21	41																WOS:000434854900003

Economic complexity and environmental degradation: Evidence from OECD countries	BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												We augment the existing knowledge on the role of economic complexity in the environment and sustainable development debate by examining the effect of economic complexity on environmental degradation (measured by ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions) contingent on income, using data from 35 OECD countries between 1998 and 2017. With the fixed effects model estimator, we find that income facilitates economic complexity to mitigate ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Also, we fit a partial linear functional-coefficient model to find that income influences economic complexity to exert a nonlinear effect on ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. We find that economic complexity leads to an increase in ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions at lower income levels but gradually dampens them as income rises. Finally, by applying the Method of Moments Quantile regression to control for distributional heterogeneity, we also find that the mitigating effect of economic complexity on ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions is transmitted through income across quantiles. The policy implications are discussed.

J	Gnangnon, SK				Gnangnon, Sena Kimm			Effect of the utilization of non-reciprocal trade preferences offered by the QUAD countries on beneficiary countries? economic complexity	JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES												This article aims to contribute to the nascent literature on the effect of non-reciprocal trade preferences (NRTPs) on economic complexity in beneficiary countries. It investigates the effect of NRTPs (Generalized Systems of Preferences - GSP - and other trade preferences) offered by the QUAD countries (Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States) on the beneficiary countries' levels of economic complexity. The analysis has used a panel dataset of 110 beneficiary countries over the period of 2002-2018, and the two-step system Generalized Method of Moments estimator. Results show that the utilization of NRTPs (either GSP programs or other trade preferences) influences positively economic complexity when beneficiary-countries' shares of exports under the relevant NRTP in total merchandise exports is very high. In addition, GSP programs and other trade preferences jointly promote economic complexity, if the utilization of either NRTP reaches high levels. The utilization of NRTPs also enhances economic complexity in countries that receive high shares of foreign direct investment flows in GDP. Finally, development aid flows are strongly complementary with the utilization of NRTPs in fostering economic complexity, especially when they reach very high amounts. One message conveyed by this analysis is that preference-granting countries (including QUAD countries) should offer both generous NRTPs and high amounts of development aid if NRTPs were to be effective in expanding the manufacturing base in the beneficiary countries, and in particular, in improving their economic complexity.																			0889-1583	1095-8681				SEP	2022	65								101214	10.1016/j.jjie.2022.101214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2022.101214													WOS:000823632600001
J	Lüthge, A				Luethge, Adrian			The concept of relatedness in diversification research: review and synthesis	REVIEW OF MANAGERIAL SCIENCE												Relatedness has become fundamental to the analysis of corporate diversification and a wide range of strategy research. Its broad definition, however, leaves researchers with substantial leeway in theorizing and operationalizing the relatedness construct. While recent advances have contributed to a more sophisticated understanding of how relatedness creates value, the heterogeneity of scholarly efforts leaves relatedness research in a state of terminological, conceptual, and methodological fragmentation and in need of consolidation. This article seeks to close this research gap by taking stock of the extant literature and providing the first systematic review focused exclusively on related diversification. The review identifies and analyzes 82 peer-reviewed scholarly articles published between 1982 and 2017, providing a critical assessment of these research efforts and proposing a holistic relatedness research framework that can serve as a common foundation for future scholarship. The review concludes by offering eight avenues for future research as a contribution to the theoretical literatures on diversification and resource-based theory.																			1863-6683	1863-6691				FEB	2020	14	1					1	35		10.1007/s11846-018-0293-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11846-018-0293-0													WOS:000512022700001

However, the current research has yet to account for the unique ways in which adolescent males engage in behaviors to fulfill their need for relatedness within their peer groups. This qualitative study investigates relatedness in six 16-to 17-year-old adolescent males. Independent observations of videotape data and a collaborative analysis revealed 13 main indicators of moment-to-moment relatedness. These indicators include expressing belonging, referring to shared experiences, and helping others out. The indicators of relatedness are discussed in the context of SDT, and additional theoretical frameworks provide an integrative understanding of the construct. Implications for research on the need for relatedness across diverse settings and populations are discussed and the utility of the indicators for professionals who work with adolescent males is considered.																			2160-3715					APR 9	2012	17	15							30															WOS:000420529100002

This study aims to measure the economic complexity of regions and its impacts on sectoral labor productivity in Turkey. By developing and employing a regional economic fitness index, the study addresses the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors at the NUTS-2 level to more effectively analyze regions' overall labor productivity. Our findings show that economic fitness positively affects regions' overall labor productivity, and this positive effect mostly stems from the industrial sector. Furthermore, our findings highlight that there is no relationship between the regional fitness index and the agricultural sector.

J	Rossouw, R; Maritz, J				Rossouw, Riaan; Maritz, Johan			Assessing economic vulnerability in South African municipalities: A focus on mining-dependent regions using the Economic Complexity Index	TOWN AND REGIONAL PLANNING												South Africa's historical reliance on mineral resources has established thriving towns and settlements, sustaining households for decades. However, the decline in demand for these resources and mine closures pose significant threats to the future of these areas, creating vulnerabilities in towns and their dependent regions. This article addresses concerns about the vulnerability of certain South African municipalities, particularly those heavily dependent on mining. Employing an Economic Complexity Index (ECI), the study identifies and classifies vulnerable mining towns and regions. The methodology involves applying the concept of economic vulnerability, utilising sub-national economic and trade data to determine the complexity of municipal economies. In addition, geospatially linked data is employed to identify mining dependent areas at risk. The results highlight municipalities with low economic complexity, signalling the need for targeted interventions and emphasising importance of economic diversification in mitigating risks. The study not only serves as a warning for current planning, but also lays the groundwork for future research and evidence-based policymaking to ensure the sustainability and resilience regional economies in South Africa.																			1012-280X	2415-0495					2023	83						57	67		10.38140/trp.83i.6696	http://dx.doi.org/10.38140/trp.83i.6696													WOS:001150189300001
J	Burlina, C; Casadei, P; Crociata, A				Burlina, Chiara; Casadei, Patrizia; Crociata, Alessandro			Economic complexity and firm performance in the cultural and creative sector: Evidence from Italian provinces	EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES												Several studies have detected a positive relationship between the spatial dynamics of cultural and creative industries (CCIs) and their social and economic outcomes. In this article, we draw upon the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) as a proxy to capture the social interactive nature that characterises CCIs and the way this affects firm performance. Our assumption is that more complex locations, endowed with different types of more sophisticated production capabilities, allow CCI firms to perform more strongly. This can depend on the higher opportunities of complex knowledge sharing and cross-fertilisation processes among different types of CCI firms or with non-CCI firms. The focus is on Italy, a country with a long-standing historical tradition in culture and creativity. We draw upon an original panel database at firm and province level (for the period 2010-2016) to compute two different ECIs, one for the CCIs and another one for the rest of the economy. Moreover, we analyse the effects these two types of complexity on the performance of firms within sectors with different levels of cultural and commercial value. We find that economic complexity of CCIs but not economic complexity of the rest of the economy matters for CCI firm performance. However, the effect is relatively weak. The same finding applies to all CCI firms, irrespective of their type of sector. Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Evidence from advanced panel estimations	ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA												Green growth is a comprehensive and integrated approach that ensures the potential economic deliverables of the natural capital on a sustainable basis. Existing studies have explored various deriving factors of green growth. However, none of the studies has evaluated the combined effect of economic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy consumption, and environment-related taxes to promote green growth. Therefore, this study quantified the impact of these variables on achieving green growth goals for BRICTS countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, Turkey, and South Africa) from 1995 to 2018. The study addressed the potential econometric issues of panel data, such as cross-section dependency, slope heterogeneity, data nonstationary through robust testing. Cross-Sectional ARDL has been applied to investigate the long-run and short-run association among the study variables. The findings suggest that economic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy consumption, and environment-related taxes significantly drive green growth in BRICTS countries. However, their marginal contribution substantially varied. Similar results are endorsed using alternative estimators and offer pertinent policy implications.

J	Lee, CC; Wang, EZ				Lee, Chien-Chiang; Wang, En-Ze			Economic Complexity and Income Inequality: Does Country Risk Matter?	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH												This research sets out to determine the nexus among economic complexity (ECI; which reflects a country's productivity), income inequality, and country risk and whether country risk affects the complexity-inequality nexus. By applying balanced panel data of 43 countries from 1991 to 2016 to a data-driven econometric methodology-finite mixture model, we provide fresh insight into this relationship from the perspective of country risk. The results indicate that the two-group finite mixture model is able to best fit our data, and that increasing economic complexity has no impact on income inequality in group A, whereas improving the structure of productivity mitigates the income gap in group B. Furthermore, country risk and the subcomponents of the former (i.e., economic risk, financial risk, and political risk) all exert effects on the complexity-inequality nexus. Specifically speaking, an increase in ECI is associated with more equal income distribution in a country with low country risk, while the improvement in productive structure cannot improve an unequal income distribution in countries under high country risk. Finally, it is noteworthy that the finite mixture model also captures information about the transformation of this nexus, with evidence demonstrating that 5 countries experience a variation in their complexity-inequality relationship over the sample period.

JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING & ECONOMICS												We investigate whether and how the complexity of derivatives influences analysts' earnings forecast properties. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that, relative to a matched control sample of non-users, analysts' earnings forecasts for new derivatives users are less accurate and more dispersed after derivatives initiation. These results do not appear to be driven by the economic complexity of derivatives, but rather the financial reporting of such economic complexity. Overall, despite their financial expertise, analysts routinely misjudge the earnings implications of firms' derivatives activity. However, we find evidence that a series of derivatives accounting standards has helped analysts improve their forecasts over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article attempts to rectify three major concerns voiced by diversification scholars. First, the distinction between industries, devised in the industrial era, is blurring in today's business environment, making their use for the study of diversification problematic. Second, most conceptualizations of relatedness employ a particularistic perspective and are thus bound to miss central aspects that are outside the scope of their theoretical vantage point. Third, the increasingly pervasive consensus that relatedness should be viewed as a multifaceted construct has not been adequately captured so far. To overcome these limitations, this study draws on the burgeoning concept of the business model as a new and more meaningful way to capture relatedness. The viability of the resulting construct, business model relatedness, is explored both conceptually and by a first empirical test. This study contributes to two theoretical strands of literature: In the field of diversification, it proposes an innovative way to conceptualize relatedness that is based on a taxonomic-as opposed to a typological-approach and that promises to better reflect firms' actual diversification logics; in business model research, it introduces a novel approach to investigating the performance implications of managing multiple business models.																			1863-6683	1863-6691				APR	2021	15	3					813	846		10.1007/s11846-019-00375-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11846-019-00375-y		JAN 2020											WOS:000574070000001

Also, critical questions arose with the critical factors, such as income inequality and economic complexity, have not been answered properly. This study explores the nexus between income inequality, economic complexity, renewable energy consumption, GDP per capita, and pollution and thus aims to reach efficient policy strategies by revealing empirical evidence. The study follows an environmental impact model structure and conducts the panel-corrected standard errors and fixed effect regression. BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are selected to conduct our research. Annual data covering the period 1990-2017 for the sample countries are employed. Consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions as an indicator of environmental pollution are used since income inequality makes more sense in terms of the consumption side of an economy and is more related to consumers rather than the production sector. The obtained results reveal that income inequality has a positive and significant impact on consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions. However, GDP per capita, renewable energy, and economic complexity reduce pollution. It is also observed that the interaction term of inequality and renewable energy decreases emissions. Findings confirm that socioeconomic indicators, such as economic complexity and income inequality with the interaction of renewable energy, are crucial factors in reducing emissions and designing a greener future.					-, Danish/AEV-8555-2022; ULUCAK, RECEP/G-2912-2018	-, Danish/0000-0003-1046-1655; ULUCAK, RECEP/0000-0001-9938-0063													0193-841X	1552-3926				FEB	2024	48	1			SI		119	142		10.1177/0193841X231173766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0193841X231173766		MAY 2023						37154303					WOS:000983355800001

Traditional feature weighting is determined by the syntactic relationship between feature and document (e.g. TF-IDF). In this paper, a semantically enriched feature weighting approach is proposed by introducing the semantic relationship between feature and document, which is implemented by taking account of the local feature relatedness - the relatedness between feature and its contextual features within each individual document. Feature relatedness is measured by two methods, document collection-based implicit relatedness measure and Wikipedia link-based explicit relatedness measure. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new feature weighting approach surpasses traditional syntactic feature weighting. Moreover, clustering quality can be further improved by linearly combining the syntactic and semantic factors. The new feature weighting approach is also compared with two existing feature relatedness-based approaches which consider the global feature relatedness (feature relatedness in the entire feature space) and the inter-document feature relatedness (feature relatedness between different documents) respectively. In the experiments, the new feature weighting approach outperforms these two related work in clustering quality and costs much less computational complexity.

J	Du, K; O'Connor, A				Du, Kai; O'Connor, Allan			Examining economic complexity as a holistic innovation system effect	SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS												The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth has remained somewhat contentious. While it is almost universally acknowledged that entrepreneurship and particularly knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship has apparent and important links to economic growth, studies to elaborate exactly how each of these factors influences economic growth return inconsistent findings. However, the measure of economic growth we suggest is too broad as an outcome metric to account for the sector of the economy that most directly contributes to the dynamics of economic growth. In this paper, we take a more nuanced approach to consider in what way and whether increasing economic complexity is related to the efficiency with which a country produces growth. We argue from a holistic innovation system (HIS) perspective that the combination of both knowledge-intensive and broader market-led business innovation will more rapidly improve the productivity levels of nations by utilising the diversity of knowledge and business resources available to that country. To test this hypothesis, we employ a dynamic version of the two-stage data envelopment analysis. We conclude that the increased economic diversity measured by the change in economic complexity can be treated as a much more refined outcome effect of a country's HIS.

J	Chu, LK; Truong, HHD; Dung, HP				Chu, Lan Khanh; Truong, Huong Hoang Diep; Dung, Hoang Phuong			Unveiling the influence of economic complexity and economic shocks on output growth volatility: evidence from a global sample	EURASIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW												While several studies have explored the impact of economic shocks on output volatility, little attention has been given to the role of a country' productive knowledge in moderating such relationship. In this paper, we raise two unsettled questions: Does productive knowledge reduce the volatility of output growth? and Does it magnify or alleviate the impacts of economic shocks on output volatility? These two questions are answered by applying the system-generalized method of moments to a dataset of 122 countries from 1996 to 2019. The paper shows that high economic complexity is significantly associated with reduced output growth volatility. However, such beneficial effect only occurs in high- and upper middle-income countries. Economic complexity is also found to strongly moderate the relationship between terms of trade shock, inflation shock, and output growth volatility. Economic complexity significantly exacerbates the unfavorable effects of these two shocks on output growth volatility, especially in highly complex economies. The discovered inter-related relationship between economic complexity, shocks, and economic volatility suggests the policymakers to be cautious in the process of transforming their economies towards higher knowledge-intensive ones.

In this paper, we discuss volunteering as a form of work and how certain experiential aspects of HCI systems supporting the volunteers' unpaid labour are instrumental in volunteer wellbeing. The sense of feeling close to others and experiencing relatedness is an important factor that can predict engagement and wellbeing of volunteers. Relatedness can be achieved in many ways, for instance, through expressing and receiving gratitude. Through four co-design workshops with n=9 participants, we identified seven perceptions of volunteers regarding their relatedness experiences. This was achieved via a case study of an online teleconferencing platform where volunteers help train and assess medical students for their medical communication skills. Findings are further discussed to inform future design to support adequate level of formalness and emotional labour in online volunteering communities.

A composite index of NIS is developed by using US patent data as a weighted sum of three, four or five variables among the following: concentration of assignees, localization, originality, diversification, and cycle time of technologies. Growth regressions confirm the significant and robust impacts of NIS3a, NIS4a, and NIS5 indices on economic growth. The common feature of these NIS indices is that they have the same component variables as their ingredients, and these are originality, cycle time, and technological diversification. NIS3a is the most parsimonious and powerful among all indices. The robustness of ECI is questionable because ECI loses significance after adding government expenditure and terms of trade variables into the regression model. Results confirm the overall importance of NIS in economic growth and justify policy efforts to improve NIS. This research is one of the first to generate a robust NIS index by using patent data only without many data requirements and free from the problem of cross-country comparability of underlying variables.

In this context, eco-innovation has become increasingly important. Nevertheless, countries are heterogeneous in terms of their eco-innovation production. Our study contributes to the understanding of the drivers of eco-innovation by analyzing the determinants of green patent production at the country level. We focus on the specific characteristics of green innovations, namely their complexity and appropriability problem, and explain how these characteristics affect firms' incentives to produce green in-novations. We then select three external dimensions related to these characteristics and examine how they affect the number of green patents produced. These three dimensions are economic complexity, protection of property rights, and effectiveness of the judicial system. Using the Furman et al. (2001) model as a starting point, this study focuses on green patent production in OECD countries for the period 2007-2016. The results show that economic complexity and intellectual property rights are key determinants of green patent production.

The current study employ's panel data estimators, for instance, fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and the canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) long-run estimators to the period from 1980 - 2017. The results suggest that economic complexity, economic development, and urbanization raise the ecological footprint in both panels. Human capital and renewable energy induce ecological footprint, whereas renewable energy increases ecological footprint in the first panel. Based on empirical evidence, the study recommends the governments of these countries promote production processes that are friendlier to the environment and introduce greener technologies in exports for a drastic reduction in environmental pollution.

J	Neagu, O				Neagu, Olimpia			The Link between Economic Complexity and Carbon Emissions in the European Union Countries: A Model Based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) Approach	SUSTAINABILITY												The aim of the paper is to apply the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model in order to explore the link between economic complexity index (ECI) and carbon emissions, in 25 selected European Union (EU) countries from 1995-2017. The study examines a cointegrating polynomial regression (CPR) for a panel data framework as well as for simple time series of individual countries. In the model is also included the variable energy intensity' as main determinant of carbon emissions. Depending on economic complexity, the CO2 emissions pattern was found to exhibit an inverted U-shaped curve: in the initial phase, pollution increases when countries augment the complexity of the products they export using and after a turning point the rise of economic complexity suppress the pollutant emissions. The panel cointegration test indicates a long-run relationship between economic complexity, energy intensity and carbon emissions. It was also found that a rise of 10% of energy intensity would lead to a 3.9% increase in CO2 emissions. The quadratic model incorporating ECI is validated for the whole panel as well as for six countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The graphical representation of the EKC in these countries is discussed. Policy implications are also included.

Relatedness computation is of great interest in different areas, such as Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, or the Semantic Web. Different methods have been proposed in the past; however, current relatedness measures lack some desirable properties for a new generation of Semantic Web applications: maximum coverage, domain independence, and universality. In this paper, we explore the use of a semantic relatedness measure between words, that uses the Web as knowledge source. This measure exploits the information about frequencies of use provided by existing search engines. Furthermore, taking this measure as basis, we define a new semantic relatedness measure among ontology terms. The proposed measure fulfils the above mentioned desirable properties to be used on the Semantic Web. We have tested extensively this semantic measure to show that it correlates well with human judgment, and helps solving some particular tasks, as word sense disambiguation or ontology matching.

Democracy, Complexity, and Science: Exploring Structural Sources of National Scientific Performance	SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY												Scholars have long hypothesized that democratic forms of government are more compatible with scientific advancement. However, empirical analysis testing the democracy-science compatibility hypothesis remains underdeveloped. This article explores the effect of democratic governance on scientific performance using panel data on 124 countries between 2007-2017. We find evidence supporting the democracy-science hypothesis. Further, using both internal and external measures of complexity, we estimate the effects of complexity as a moderating factor between the democracy-science connection. The results show differential main effects of economic complexity, globalization, and international collaboration on scientific performance, as well as significant interaction effects that moderate the effect of democracy on scientific performance. The findings show the significance of democratic governance and complex systems in national scientific performance.

However, studies that emphasize the connection between economic complexity and trade flows are still sparse. This research aims to examine the role of economic complexity on bilateral trade flows of 27 countries in COMESA and East Asia using the gravity model from 1995 till 2019. Based on countries' geographical regions and income levels, the empirical estimation of the study applied the Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator. The main results are robust to vari-ous model specifications and consistent with the expectations of the gravity model indicators. The study found strong empirical evidence that the expansion of economic sophistication and diversification enlarges trade flows of different exported goods. Explicitly, economic complexity increases the exports of machinery and transport equipment alongside manufactured products, while its effects on agricultural exports are negligible. Thus, this study proposes that the countries should engage in more sophisticated Research and Development (R&D), attract multinational companies, establish industrial policies, and improve their productivity by utilizing the existing production network. They should move to a more diversified production and trade structure to enhance their bilateral trade flows.

However, its innovative capabilities remain limited. Taking these factors into consideration, we determined the country's optimal diversification path by identifying prospective export sectors which would enhance the country's competitiveness. We combine the product space and proximity methodologies on predicted export data together with a company-level analysis. We identified machinery for specialized industries and parts thereof (SITC 7284), machine-tools for specialized industries parts or accessories (SITC 7281) and power hand tools, pneumatic or non-electric, and parts thereof (SITC 7541) as the most prospective categories in terms of high complexity, expected trade volume growth, proximity to Czechia's existing production capabilities and manufacturing base operated by large, highly innovative Czech -owned firms.

J	Lien, LB; Klein, PG				Lien, Lasse B.; Klein, Peter G.			Using Competition to Measure Relatedness	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT												The conventional approach to measuring interindustry relatedness uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to capture the "distance" between industries. Although relatedness measures based on SIC codes (or equivalent classifications) are readily available and easy to compute, they do not screen effectively for the conditions under which related diversification creates value. This article constructs an alternative, survivor-based measure of interindustry relatedness and compares it to similar measures based on distances between SIC codes. The authors find that survivor-based measures consistently outperform SIC-based measures in predicting form's decisions to enter new markets, even when herding tendencies and motives related to mutual,forbearance are taken into account.																			0149-2063	1557-1211				AUG	2009	35	4					1078	1107		10.1177/0149206308328505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206308328505													WOS:000268778500011

We develop a conceptual framework anchored in two building blocks: first, the conceptualization of innovation as a process spanning technology, design, and market activities; second, the application and extension of the principle of relatedness to understand developments within and between the different innovation activities. We offer an empirical investigation where we operationalize the different innovation activities using three intellectual property rights: patents, industrial designs, and trademarks. We provide two separate analyses of how relatedness and cross-relatedness matter for the emergence of new specializations: for 259 NUTS-2 European regions and for 363 metropolitan statistical areas of the US. While relatedness is significantly associated with new regional specializations for all three innovation activities, cross-relatedness between activities also plays a significant role. Our study has important policy implications for developing and monitoring smart specialization regional strategies.

The study also aims to understand the dynamics behind the connection between structural transformation and unemployment by comparing the results from each country. This paper also focuses on the effects of economic complexity on the breakdown of unemployment rates including female, male, youth female and youth male unemployment divisions. In the study, firstly, cross-sectional dependence is tested for all variables; secondly, the CADF test as a second -generation unit root test is applied; thirdly, the parameter constancy test is applied to each model, and then the models are estimated using the panel regression method with random coefficients. The study reveals a geographical distinction between the ten economies. Economic complexity significantly affects all types of unemployment in Poland, but it does not affect unemployment in Asian and African countries. The other result of the study is that even in Poland, the decreasing effect of ECI (Economic Complexity Index) on unemployment is different for women and men.

According to the development index, the role of international trade is indeed crucial for the development of the national economy. However, the visualization of the international trade profile of the country is the prerequisite of governmental policy decision-makers and guidance for forecasting of foreign trade. Design/methodology - We have utilized data visualization techniques in order to visualize the import & export product space and trade partners of South Korea. Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) were used to identify the Korean international trade diversification, whereas the time series approach is used to forecast the economy and foreign trade variables. Findings - Our results show that Chine, U.S, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan are the leading trade partners of Korea. Overall, the ECI of South Korea is growing significantly as compared to China, Hong Kong, and other developed countries of the world. The expected values of total import and export volume of South Korea are approximately US$535.21 and US$ 781.23B, with the balance of trade US$ 254.02B in 2025. It was also observed from our analysis that imports & exports are equally substantial to the GDP of Korea and have a significant correlation with GDP, GDP per capita, and ECI. Originality/value - To maintain the growth rate of international trade and efficient competitor for the trade partners, we have visualized the South Korea trade profile, which provides the information of significant export and import products as well as main trade partners and forecasting.																				1229-828X				FEB	2020	24	1					131	145		10.35611/jkt.2020.24.1.131	http://dx.doi.org/10.35611/jkt.2020.24.1.131													WOS:000524179100007

However, hindrances like challenges towards energy transition efforts, stable political institutions, unclean economic globalization practices, and transiting to a complex economy could potentially delay the nation's attainment of its environmental goals. Against this backdrop, the current study focuses on examining the roles of political risk, economic globalization, energy transition, and economic complexity on ecological sustainability in Malaysia. In contrast to previous studies, this study innovatively incorporates a dummy variable to account for potential structural breaks that may occur during the study period. Furthermore, this study used an innovative environmental proxy which incorporates both the demand and supply aspect of the environment during computation. Using the time series data from 1984 to 2018 and employed the ARDL estimator method, the empirical results indicate that economic globalization is associated with ecological deterioration in Malaysia in the long run. On the other hand, economic complexity, political stability, and energy transition are shown to promote ecological sustainability in Malaysia in the long run. Moreover, the bootstrap time varying causality method demonstrates that each of the regressors has the capacity to predict the load capacity factor during distinct sub-periods.					oncu, erdem/AAC-5322-2022; UZUN, BERNA/GXN-1283-2022; ONCU, Erdem/HNQ-0857-2023	oncu, erdem/0000-0002-3506-5803; ONCU, Erdem/0000-0002-3506-5803													1350-4509	1745-2627				FEB 17	2024	31	2					206	221		10.1080/13504509.2023.2268573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2023.2268573		OCT 2023											WOS:001089168500001

RENEWABLE ENERGY												The current era faces the devastating threats of global warming than what is evident in the pre-industrial age. Efforts toward resolving these environmental issues have heightened the calls for pro-green policy measures in which renewable energy and green finance stand out. Consequently, this study examines the impact of renewable energy, green finance, technological innovation, and economic complexity on sustainable development captured by sustainable economic growth and carbon neutrality in China. The empirical model endogenizes the role of natural resource dependence and human capital. The analysis is based on annual time series data from 1996 to 2018 estimated using autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The empirical results reveal that renewable energy (RE) and technological innovations (TECIN) are fundamental factors whose engagement is not negligible if the other indicators must provide desirable and consistent growth and environmental effects that support sustainable development. In particular, the essential roles of green finance on sustainable development are empirically confirmed for China. Interestingly, the robustness analyses conducted provided substantial backings for the main results. Practical policy implications leading to the sustenance of green finance, renewable energy, and technological innovation for driving sustainable development in the Chinese economy are formulated based on empirical results.

Second, can increasing export quality lead to the improvement of the environment? Given that the relationship of the ecological footprint and its determinants has been revealed to be nonlinear, the use of the quantile approach is supported. This finding led us to the central hypothesis of this research: economic complexity and export quality first deteriorate the ecological footprint (i.e., in lower quantiles), and the middle and higher quantiles contribute to reducing or mitigating environmental damage. The effect of economic complexity and export quality on the ecological footprint was researched using a two-step approach. First, club convergence was applied to identify the countries that follow a similar convergence path. After this, panel quantile regression was used to determine the explanatory power of economic complexity and export quality on the ecological footprint of 98 countries from 1990 to 2014. The club convergence revealed four convergent groups. Panel quantile regression was used because the relationship between the ecological footprint and its explanatory variables was shown to be nonlinear for the group of countries identified by the club convergence approach. GDP, nonrenewable energy consumption, and the population damage the environment. Urbanisation contributes to reducing the ecological footprint. Export quality and trade openness reduce the ecological footprint, but not at all quantiles. The effect of trade openness mitigating the ecological footprint is lost at the 90th quantile. Export quality becomes a reducer of the ecological footprint in the 50th quantile or above, and in the higher quantiles, its contribution to reducing the footprint is vast. Economic complexity aggravates the ecological footprint in low quantiles (10th), becomes non-statistically significant in the 25th quantile, and reduces the ecological footprint in higher quantiles. Policymakers must identify the impact of the ecological footprint and consider the demand and supply side of economics.

Economic Complexity of Russian Regions and their Potential to Diversify	ZHURNAL NOVAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA-JOURNAL OF THE NEW ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION												The author estimates the level of economic complexity for Russian regions, as well as their potential to diversify exports. We construct an export database that provides export data for 80 Russian regions to use along with a larger dataset of 148 countries. This database gives a comprehensive view of Russian regions' export products. We also account for the regional origin of products exported, which allows us to estimate the level of complexity of Russian regional economies more accurately. We provide taxonomy of the regions by a level of complexity of export industries and then for the policy purposes we evaluate opportunities for further export development by region. We pick up two Russian regions to illustrate our main findings. Our results fall in line with works by (Hausmann et al., 2007; Hidalgo et al., 2007), which show a positive relationship between economic complexity and potential for the development of regional export industries.

APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The objective of this paper is to link the literatures on economic complexity, income equality and environmental quality within the context of the Environmental Kuznets Trilemma. Within this framework, it is possible to measure the presence of an impossible trinity of irreconcilable objectives: economic growth, equal distribution of income and environmental sustainability. Our paper revisits this trilemma by focusing on economic complexity (EC) indexes instead of direct measures of economic growth, and applies this analysis to the sub-national level. We link these three cutting-edge topics by means of novel datasets computed for the Spanish economy at the province level (NUTS-3) for a long period (2002-16). Our paper also sheds new light on the spatial patterns of the trilemma's three dimensions and their implications for the future of Spain's more peripheral regions.

TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY												This empirical research scrutinizes the nexus between information and communication technologies (ICT), renewable energy, economic complexity, human capital, financial development, and ecological footprint for E-7 and G-7 countries over the period from 1995 to 2018. We use four variables (Mobile cellular subscription, fixed broadband subscription, fixed telephone subscription, Internet consumers) for the ICT index prepared through principal component analysis. For empirical analysis, after testing the cross-sectional dependency, this study performs the second-generation method. From the E-7 countries' perspective, the empirical results reveal that ICT, economic complexity, and human capital increase the pollution level while renewable energy significantly reduces it. The estimated financial development coefficient is established to be statistically insignificant. In G-7 countries, all potential factors significantly improve the environmental quality except financial development. Moreover, the interaction between ICT and human capital significantly reduces the ecological footprint level in both panel countries. Therefore, we can observe that there is a wide discrepancy in these countries. The only common thing is that in these countries, bidirectional causality is discovered between ICT, human capital, and ecological footprint. Based on these empirical findings, several practice policy implications for ICT, renewable energy, economic complexity, human capital, financial development, and ecological footprint are discussed.

Economic complexity is taken as an indicator of the sophisticated and knowledge-based production process of an economy. The empirical analysis is conducted by using both the first- and second-generation panel unit root tests (URTs) and panel cointegration tests, cross-sectional dependence tests, error correction model (ECM), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and fixed effects quantile regression (FE-QR). According to panel URTs and panel cointegration tests, all variables are stationary at the first difference and cointegrated, respectively. The FMOLS results reveal that the impact of economic complexity on carbon emissions is positive and statistically significant in the long run. In addition, the environmental Kuznets curve theory is also validated in these economies. The FE-QR results suggest that the impact of economic complexity on emissions is higher in the economies where carbon emissions are low.

However, previous empirical investigations on this topic are confined to understanding the direct effects of economic complexity on environmental quality with equivocal outcomes. Therefore, this study not only probed the effects of ECP on the ecological footprint (EF) but also explored the indirect environmental effects of ECP through the channel of economic growth. To do so, the study employed the unit-root tests with structural breaks and without structural breaks. Afterward, the newly developed Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AARDL) method was used on the time series Indian data from 1970 to 2017 in the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) framework. The findings disclosed cointegration among the selected variables. Notably, the AARDL test provided a reliable conclusion by using three different tests compared to the conventional ARDL model that relies on just one F-statistics. The long-run empirical results unfolded that ECP not only reduces footprint but also decreases the adverse environmental impacts of economic growth. In addition, energy intensity and economic growth contribute to escalating the EF, and thereby, increase environmental degradation. Nevertheless, population density decreases the footprint, and thus, stimulates ecological sustainability. Besides, ECP Granger causes EF. After this, several diagnostic tests were performed to confirm the stability of the models and the results were verified using the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares test. Lastly, the study directed policies to increase the level of sophisticated knowledge-based production for sustainable growth.

J	Zhang, YP; Qayyum, M; Yu, YY				Zhang, Yanping; Qayyum, Muhammad; Yu, Yuyuan			Effects of resource abundance on economic complexity: Evidence from spatial panel model	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This study utilizes the spatial panel method to investigate the direct and spatial spillover effects of resource rents on economic complexity (ECI) based on a cross-country panel data covering 123 countries from 1995 to 2018. First, our empirical results highlight a strong clustering trend in the geographical distribution of global economic complexity. Second, we find that overall resource abundance significantly affects local ECI negatively, aligning with the resource curse hypothesis. However, the evidence remains inconclusive concerning the negative effects of overall resource abundance on the ECI of neighboring countries. Third, as for local ECI, the resource curse hypothesis holds for oil rents and mineral rents, a resource blessing emerges for gas rents. Interestingly, while oil and gas rents could significantly hinder the ECI improvement of spatially related countries, coal rents and mineral rents exhibit positive and significant spatial spillover effects. Fourth, our regional heterogeneity analysis yields very nuanced and diversified findings, notably revealing negative spatial spillover effects of oil rents for most regions except NAEU (Northern America and Europe). Conversely, underdeveloped regions like SSA (SubSaharan Africa) benefit from coal rents for not only their own ECI, but also their neighboring countries. Lastly, we also find that institutional quality and financial openness can mitigate the adverse impacts of resource rents on ECI. Yet, an increase in FDI inflows may exacerbate these effects.

Currently, there remain three major challenges in the latest research: (1) The objective function of collective entity linking does not fully embrace the concept of "collective linking". (2) The objective function employs the mean value rather than the maximum value of the entity relatedness as a link parameter, while discounting the importance of the strong logical associations between the text and language for meaning recognition. (3) The objective function utilizes only one type of 2-hop path to contribute to entity relatedness, thereby disregarding other types of 2-hop path that exist in actual HINs. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a strong-relatedness-sequence-based fine-grained collective entity linking method (SRSCL). The SRSCL is capable of capturing the contextual information of the entity in the HINs, thereby providing improved accuracy in entity linking. Specifically, SRSCL constructs a knowledge representation learning model and proposes an overall semantic similarity model for entity mentions and candidate entities to solve the objective function and thereby reflect the idea of "collective linking". Additionally, a strong-relatednesssequence-based overall relatedness measurement model is proposed for candidate entities to emphasize the strong logical associations between them. Furthermore, SRSCL defines three types of 2-hop path and evaluates the importance of each path to accurately measure the relatedness of entities. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRSCL is more effective in capturing the overall relatedness of entities than the latest model. Particularly, when the number of entity mentions contained in one sliding window is greater than 6, the proposed SRSCL improves the precision, recall and F1 score by more than 10% compared with the latest model.

The Effects of Compound Macroeconomic Variables on Economic Growth, Evidence from North African Countries, using PARDL and the PVAR Approaches	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS												The empirical economic literature has relied on traditional factors such as capital and labor in explaining the causes of economic growth. However, re-cently, the studies used new economic concepts based on a wide number of factors expressed in compound indicators (such as index of; digitization, com-petitiveness, innovation, Economic Complexity, and Macroeconomic instabil-ity) to investigate their impacts on economic growth. So, the main objective of this study is to examine the effect of Economic Complexity, Economic Free-dom, and Macroeconomic Instability on Economic Growth in the North African region between 1999-2019. The study used the first generation of panel unit root test (IPS, ADF, PP) To identify the individual root in Cross-Section Inde-pendence. The unit root result shows that variables GDPg and ECI are station-ary at level (0) while variables EFI and MII are stationary at level (1). This study employed the PARDL and the PVAR approaches to investigate the linkages between the studied variables. Then, to clarify the direction of the relationship between the variables, we employ the Dumitrescu-Hurlin approach of causal-ity test appropriate for panel data. The fin-dings reveal a significant long-run cointegration relationship among ECI, EFI, MII, and GDPg at the 5% signifi-cance level. Furthermore, the PVAR estimation approaches confirm that; the economic freedom index, macroeconomic instability index, and economic complexity index are significantly and positively associated with GDP growth. The empirical results also proved a critical causality from macroeconomic in-stability to GDP growth and passing across Economic Complexity and Eco-nomic Freedom. In this context, to boost economic growth in North African countries, economic policymakers must work on; Reducing economic insta-bility, increasing levels of economic Complexity, and supporting economic Freedom.																			1800-5845	1800-6698					2023	19	3					161	178		10.14254/1800-5845/2023.19-3.13	http://dx.doi.org/10.14254/1800-5845/2023.19-3.13													WOS:001021797300013

Previous approaches to computing semantic relatedness used statistical techniques or lexical resources. We propose Searcher Result Analysis (SRA), a novel method that captures related text from search engine by issuing proper queries. Inferring the relatedness is then based on word occurrences in certain number of pages. Compared with the previous state of the art, using SRA to computing semantic relatedness based on Wikipedia can achieve competitive results with no need to maintain a local copy of remote resources. It is also shown that the correctness can be further improved by selecting proper knowledge resources or corpora for SRA.																					978-0-7695-4880-7				2012							205	209		10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.29	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.29													WOS:000423017600042

From an economic point of view, the importance of the integration of countries is fundamental for their development simply because most of them are part of some system of international economic integration. In this work, the issue of economic integration will not be discussed in depth but instead will oversee proposing some well-known metrics in the field of economic development that could be very useful as analysis and decision-making tools. in the process of regional economic integration. In this sense, this work proposes using concepts and metrics of Economic Complexity and Economic Fitness to identify combined productive capacities between countries that are part of an economic block, whether real or fictitious. The problem in understanding how economically integrate the countries is to identify the combined productive capacities that would exist if two or more countries that make up an economic block are considered as a single country. Experimental analyzes were carried out for a fictitious case, where a world with 10 countries and 15 products is presented; in addition, 3 economic blocks were defined, which were analyzed applying economic complexity and economic fitness metrics. The results obtained reflect the great importance of economic integration since, by establishing economic blocks, it is possible to capture more productive capacities by improving both the diversity of the economic block and the ubiquity of the products produced in it by addressing the productive capacities of the member countries.

A strong sector is considered as an element of the structure of the region's economy, the share of production volume of which is higher than for the Russian Federation as a whole. A metric was used to determine the proximity of any two regions according to the structure of strong sectors. Using this metric, minimal spanning trees were constructed to identify groups of regions with a close structure of strong sectors. The structures revealed in this way can be considered as basic when choosing the directions of development of the subjects of the Russian Federation. The results of grouping the regions according to the structure of strong sectors do not contradict the results of clustering the regions previously obtained by the authors according to the sectoral structure of the GRP and make it possible to clarify the structure of the economy of the regions previously included in the "uniformly developed" cluster. For each group, codes and names of sectors that are its distinctive feature, as well as codes of sectors strong for all regions of the group are given. This information quite fully characterizes the structure of the economic complexity of the regions and can be used to solve project management tasks.

This study endeavors to analyze the effect of economic complexity-understood as structural transformation toward more sophisticated and knowledge-based production, economic progress, renewable energy consumption, and population growth over carbon emissions. Our study employs panel data for a sample of 28 OECD countries covering the period of 1990-2014. The main contribution to the energy economics literature is given by bringing together the concept of environmental degradation and economic complexity controlling via renewable energy consumption and economic and population growth.

Seven variables are examined from 1995 to 2020. In order to investigate the interdependence of these variables, this research makes use of quantile vector autoregression (QVAR). Knowledge sharing in production plays a fundamental role in safeguarding the energy system's resilience in Vietnam, a connection that has been understated until now. The quantile at 50% signifies the average connectedness throughout the period, as computed through directional net connectedness over a dynamically evolving quantile, illustrating a high level of connectedness for both substantial positive changes (exceeding 80%) and the fluctuations in EC and GEC (falling below the 20% quantile). The findings indicate that both brief and prolonged periods influence dynamic connectivity, accounting for 5% and around 2%, respectively.

Examining dynamic net pairwise directional connection at a certain quantile demonstrates that notable 2016 occurrences, such as the Revised Power Development Plan 7, affect the volatility of both green energy consumption (GEC) and economic complexity (EC).

However, while relatedness has been argued as a key concept of AAL/telecare, it is mostly interpreted as aspects of interpersonal connectedness and feeling of support. As people may relate to a variety of human and non-human actors in care networks, we explore different forms of relatedness between older people and other actors, including institutions and technology. To this end, we review related literature from Psychology and HCI. We then present a long-term AAL project where we conducted 20 qualitative interviews with 15 older people. We identified interwoven forms of relatedness that involved diverse social, organisational and technical actors, explaining, for example, people's motivations for engagement, the ways they imbue technology with organisational values, and the impact of technology usability. We suggest that expanding the concept of relatedness beyond the interpersonal can provide a more holistic and nuanced view, integrating interpersonal, social, organisational and technical concerns for designing effective sociotechnical ecosystems around older people and AAL/telecare.

But how can a country or region exactly "go green"? Transforming current economic structures into a green economy is a complex process. The structure of an economy is determined by the type of jobs that are present in an economy. Therefore, the creation of green jobs is one of the components of the "going green" process. Using occupational data for 27 Brazilian states between 2003 and 2013, this paper examines whether the level of economic complexity of a state explains why one state has a greener occupation space than another. First, we construct a "green jobs index" which quantitatively measures the greenness of the occupation space of a state. We then empirically show that economic complexity has a positive explanatory power when it comes to differences in this green jobs index. We also show that transitioning through this occupational space is a slow and difficult process. Nonetheless, we find evidence of declining regional differences in greenness. Initially, states which had a low green jobs index became relatively greener than states that had initially a high green jobs index. This indicates convergence across states.					de Oliveira, Heder/AAK-2907-2020; Swart, Julia/AFT-0201-2022	de Oliveira, Heder/0000-0002-1324-7286; Swart, Julia/0000-0001-9840-0026													1387-585X	1573-2975				JAN	2021	23	1					723	746		10.1007/s10668-020-00605-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00605-4		JAN 2020											WOS:000515595100002

S.; Mariano, Enzo B.; Hartmann, Dominik			Linking Economic Complexity, Diversification, and Industrial Policy with Sustainable Development: A Structured Literature Review	SUSTAINABILITY												Research on economic diversification and complexity has made significant advances in understanding economic development processes, but has only recently explored environmental and social sustainability considerations. In this article we evaluate the current state of this emerging literature and reveal 13 research gaps. A total of 35 different keywords and methods from structured literature reviews and network science helped to identify 374 scientific articles between 1988 and 2020 and revealed a fragmented research landscape around three larger network communities: (1) industrial policies, climate change, and green growth; (2) economic complexity and its association with inequality and environmental sustainability; and (3) economic diversification, including studies on livelihood diversification in poor areas. Economic complexity research applies new empirical methods and considers both social and environmental sustainability, but seldom scrutinizes theory and policy. Industrial policy research focuses on green growth policies but tends to omit social sustainability issues and advanced empirical methods. Research on economic diversification in poor regions provides insights on the livelihood diversification of farmers, but is disconnected from the economic complexity and industrial policy research. This review helps to summarize the main contributions and shows pathways for potential mutual learning between these communities for the sake of sustainable development.

Lacking conclusive evidence, particularly within the G-20 countries, this study endeavors to establish the intricate linkages between economic development, natural resources, and economic complexity. A subset of G-20 economies from 1990 to 2021 was used to analyze the results of the second-generation CS-ARDL model. After accounting for variables like corruption, total labor force, gross capital formation, trade openness, and inflow of foreign direct investment, we find that natural resources, economic complexity, corruption and gross capital formation are significant and adverse predictors of economic growth. Natural resource dependence is susceptible to price fluctuations and sustainability concerns, economic complexity may introduce market volatility challenges, corruption erodes trust and transparency, and excessive gross capital formation can lead to economic imbalances. On the other hand, economic growth is positively impacted by the additional effects of the control variables, including foreign direct investment, trade openness and labor force. In crafting its policy recommendations, this study artfully weaves a tapestry that resonates with the core principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These strategic imperatives include the adept stewardship of resources, the cultivation of economic diversity, the seamless facilitation of trade, the fortification against corruption, and a harmonious symphony that underscores financial stability and the nurturing of human capital, ultimately painting a vivid portrait of sustainable economic growth.

However, there are few researchers that concentrate on mining the relationship between courses. In this paper, we propose a method to compare relatedness between courses based on representing courses as concept graphs. The concept graph comprises not only the semantic relationship between concepts but also the importance of concepts in the course. Moreover, we take a cluster analysis to find relevant concepts between two courses and take advantage of Similar Concept Groups to compute the degree of course relatedness.

J	Gnangnon, SK				Gnangnon, Sena Kimm			The quality of Aid for Trade flows and economic complexity	INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY												The few existing studies on the effect of Aid for Trade (AfT) flows on economic complexity have reached inconclusive outcomes. The present analysis re-examines this issue through the lens of the concept of 'quality of AfT flows' that takes into account not only the amount of AfT flows, but also the predictability and volatility of these capital inflows. A country enjoys a better quality of AfT flows if it receives higher AfT flows in predictable and less volatile fashions. We investigate the effect of the quality of AfT flows on economic complexity, over a set of 86 countries and the period from 2004 to 2019, and using the within fixed effects estimator and the Method of Moments Quantile Regression with fixed effects approach. The findings suggest that not only does a better quality of AfT flows fosters economic complexity in recipient countries, but its positive effect is larger in less complex economies (including poorest countries) than in relatively more complex economies among recipient countries. These findings reveal that what really matters for the enhancement of economic complexity in developing countries may not be only the amounts of the total AfT flows, but more importantly the predictability and the stability of these resource inflows. Improving the quality of AfT flows by increasing AfT amounts in predictable and stable fashions would be beneficial to developing countries and particularly to a greater extent to poorest countries among them.																			1612-4804	1612-4812				2024 MAR 18	2024										10.1007/s10368-024-00593-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10368-024-00593-0		MAR 2024											WOS:001186094700001
J	Ashraf, J				Ashraf, Junaid			Spatial-temporal nexus of economic complexity interaction with human capital and political stability on environmental quality and their possible causes of change for BRI countries	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Environmental degradation (ED) and the factors that influence it are being addressed on several levels, including individual, domestic, and geographical. Our research collaborates in two ways. First, it investigates the effect of economic complexity (EC) interaction with human capital (HC) and political stability on the environmental quality of 55 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. Second, spatial impacts are considered when calculating variables influencing environmental quality at the geographical level. The relevance of geographical effects is determined using different diagnostic procedures, and direct and spillover effects are evaluated using the Spatial Durbin Model to examine the phenomena. Political stability reduces ED and improves ecological sustainability by regulating EC and ED. Surprisingly, the spatial interaction term of HC and EC indicates that EC improves environmental quality through the HC channel in the native country and its neighbors. From these findings, policymakers might gain new insights and enhance environmental quality in BRI countries.																			0964-0568	1360-0559				MAR 20	2024	67	4					870	896		10.1080/09640568.2022.2139226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2022.2139226		OCT 2022											WOS:000879676600001

A decomposed analysis	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE												Indonesia aspires to reduce 29%-41% of the nation's carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero-carbon emissions by 2060. The production paradigm of the Indonesian economy still relies entirely on dirty energy sources, including coal, oil and gas. As it is a natural resource-abundant developing country, we simulate the decomposed carbon emissions response to mounting economic growth and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) for the next 20 years, applying a dynamic simulated autoregressive distributed lag approach using time series data from 1966 to 2018. Our investigation demonstrates that economic growth and increased ECI help to reduce carbon emissions-oil use intensity and vice versa. Conversely, gas and coal emissions intensities respond positively to ECI, but negatively to economic growth. Our findings confirm that inadequate technological improvement in gas and coal use-oriented industries are detrimental to decoupling the economic growth-emissions relationship.

J	Le Caous, ES; Huarng, F				Le Caous, Emilie Sophie; Huarng, Fenghueih			Economic Complexity and Human Development: Moderated by Logistics and International Migration	SUSTAINABILITY												Living in a world where we can expand our economic wealth and the richness of human life is the core of the human development concept. Greater well-being for all can be achieved by improving people's capabilities and more importantly, by giving individuals the ability to use their knowledge and skills. The economic complexity index (i.e., ECI) is a new indicator that defines a country's complexity. Through a vast network, citizens can transfer an enormous quantity of relevant knowledge, leading to the creation of diversified and complex products. However, the relationship between economic complexity and human development is not that simple. Thus, this paper aimed to understand it deeper-international migration and logistics performance are used as moderators. Hierarchical linear modeling was the statistical tool used to analyze two groups of countries from 1990 to 2017. For robustness and to deal with possible endogeneity issues, different year lags were also included. The results show that international migration and logistics performance are decisive moderators as they change the relationship between economic complexity and human development.																				2071-1050				FEB	2021	13	4							1867	10.3390/su13041867	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13041867													WOS:000624760500001
J	Aerni, P				Aerni, Philipp			Decentralized Economic Complexity in Switzerland and Its Contribution to Inclusive and Sustainable Change	SUSTAINABILITY												The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim at harnessing economic complexity for sustainable and inclusive economic growth by calling for a decade of joint action. In this paper, we show how the action-oriented collaborative culture of complex and competitive economic ecosystems in places outside the major population centers may generate significant positive external effects for society and the environment at large. We illustrate this by means of two small case studies in Switzerland, a country with a federal system that enables decentralized economic development. The first case study investigates the economic ecosystem of the small town Monthey to show how productive migrants and embedded multinational companies increase the knowledge and know-how of local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The successful collaboration of insiders and outsiders accounts for the internal economic complexity that makes the region innovative and competitive. The second case study highlights the importance of the federalist system by showing how the canton of Solothurn succeeded in nurturing globally competitive export-oriented SMEs. We conclude that the success of these inclusive economic ecosystems in unexpected places may only be understood in the specific geographical, historical and political context, as well as the general openness of these regions toward entrepreneurial migrants and global business. The importance of local social capital makes it hard to replicate such success stories. Nevertheless, they indicate that the global knowledge economy may not just pose a threat, but also offer great opportunities for productive regions beyond the major global high-tech clusters of economic complexity.

J	Lyubimov, IL; Iakubovskii, IV				Lyubimov, Ivan L.; Iakubovskii, Igor, V			Higher Education as a Driver of Regional Economy	EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA												This paper discusses the details of the associative link between the structure of economy and the quality of higher education for Russian regions. Such a link facilitates the interplay between the sectoral structure of a regional economy and its higher education system. This kind of economic policy is consistent with a number of theoretical views on the role that human capital plays in the process of economic growth. On top of that, the paper provides an approach which helps in identifying the directions of development of both the system of higher education and the economic structure of the respective region, as well as coordinating these two processes. In addition, we characterize the complexity of each regional economy and the development of its higher education system. The corresponding indicators complement broadly accepted metrics, such as GRP per capita, which help distinguish between regional economies. In particular, the measure of economic complexity reflects how complex, on average, the industries producing the respective GRP level are. In the paper, we also identify a positive association between the complexity of regional economies and the quality and diversity of higher education programs at the regional level. Nevertheless, a number of regions stay apart because their higher education systems are relatively more advanced compared with the level of complexity of their economies. This result lets us suggest a discussion about the main goals of the regional system of higher education. The provision of training to meet the demands of the local labor market is an important task of the education system. However, a high-quality education system can in itself be considered as a sector of the local economy which is important to develop. Moreover, a high-quality education system facilitates labor mobility, providing better access to better jobs.

To overcome this issue, this study uncovers the effect of economic complexity, foreign direct investment, and renewable electricity on the load capacity factor (LCF). The panel nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) method is used to analyze BRICS-T countries for the period 1990-2018. The outcomes reveal that a positive shock in economic complexity has a long-run positive impact on the LCF, but is insignificant in the short-run. Similarly, a negative shock in economic complexity has only a short-run environmental-promoting effect. A negative shock in foreign direct investment improves the LCF in both the short-run and long-run, but a positive shock in foreign direct investment promotes environmental quality only in the long-run. Similarly, renewable electricity improves environmental quality in the both short-run and long-run. Both control variables (i.e., economic growth and fossil fuel consumption) have a negative impact on the LCF in the both short-run and long-run. Also, the findings are robust to advanced econometric methodologies. Based on empirical findings, relevant policy points for improving environmental quality and achieving sustainable development goals are proposed.

J	Neffke, F; Henning, M				Neffke, Frank; Henning, Martin			Skill relatedness and firm diversification	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Because of the importance of human capital, a firm's choice of diversification targets will depend on whether these targets offer opportunities for leveraging existing human resources. We propose to quantify the similarity of different industries' human capital or skill requirements, that is, the industries' skill relatedness, by using information on cross-industry labor flows. Labor flows among industries can be used to identify skill relatedness, because individuals changing jobs will likely remain in industries that value the skills associated with their previous work. Estimates show that firms are far more likely to diversify into industries that have ties to the firms' core activities in terms of our skill-relatedness measure than into industries without such ties or into industries that are linked by value chain linkages or by classification-based relatedness.

J	Ahmad, M; Satrovic, E				Ahmad, Munir; Satrovic, Elma			Role of economic complexity and government intervention in environmental sustainability: Is decentralization critical?	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												While climate change mitigation agenda and energy governance are the central concerns of climatologists and energy-environmental scientists, the mainstream literature seems silent on whether a decentralized governance structure is desirable for complex economic systems and governmental intervention approaches to realize sustainable environments. To frame this critical research gap, we investigate the contribution of fiscal decentralization in moderating the influence of economic complexity and government intervention on energy and carbon efficiency in the presence of real GDP per capita. We employ a panel method of moments quantile regression (MQR) on data from selected seven fiscally decentralized OECD countries over the 1995-2018 period. The empirical results uncovered that economic complexity causes a drop in energy efficiency (at 1, 5, and 10% significance levels), with a more magnified effect in countries with low environmental sustainability levels. Conversely, our findings exerted that government intervention discourages energy and carbon intensity (at diversified significance levels as per probability scores of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10), with heterogeneous degrees of impact across diversified model specifications. Regarding direct influence, our outcomes exhibited that expenditure and revenue decentralization aid in energy and carbon efficiency. Concerning moderation effects, expenditure and revenue decentralization successfully rejuvenate the environmental sustainability effects of economic complexity and government intervention (at 1 and 5% significance levels). Finally, our study gauged that the EKC phenomenon exists among the sampled OECD members, indicating that economic growth in the region will be the driving force behind the region's long-term environmental sustainability. Estimation results are robust to the alternative dependent variable, carbon intensity and alternative econometric technique, ordinary least squares with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. A fiscally decentralized paradigm is desirable from a policy standpoint for government intervention in complex economies to realize environmental sustainability goals.

Two decades ago, a new global standard of intellectual property swept across developing and industrialized nations through the implementation of the WTO's TRIPS Agreement. Many years later, the issue of patent rights remains contentious. In this paper, we focus on the effects of patent rights systems on total factor productivity growth, using dynamic panel regression analysis for 70 countries from 1965 to 2009. We show that the effects of stronger or more rigorous patent systems are insignificant for productivity growth in both developing and industrialized countries. Why does the strength of patents appear to have no impact on productivity? Classic economic theory suggests that stronger patent systems incentive innovative output with important spill-over effects for productivity and growth. We offer an alternative explanation using data from the Economic Complexity Index. We find that while patents rights are increasingly irrelevant to productivity, the relationship between economic complexity and productivity is highly positive and significant. Our results are consistent with the contributions of the absorptive capacity theory in that they suggest it is not the discovery and ownership of novel products and processes at the innovative frontier that induces productive growth, but the ability to adapt, replicate and diffuse along the international productive chain.

J	Bryce, DJ; Winter, SG				Bryce, David J.; Winter, Sidney G.			A General Interindustry Relatedness Index	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												For empirical work in the resource-based view of the firm, characterizing the resources that are responsible for firm growth is difficult because valuable resources are often tacit, ambiguous, or difficult to identify. This is a particular problem for empirical assessments that rely upon the concept of relatedness between resources to characterize the direction of growth of the firm. We tackle the problem for the general case by developing a general interindustry relatedness index. The index harnesses the relatedness information embedded in the multiproduct organization decisions of every diversified firm in the U. S. manufacturing economy. The index is general in that it can be used across industry contexts without requiring explicit identification of resources and it provides a percentile relatedness rank for every possible pair of four-digit Standard Industrial Classification manufacturing industries. The general index is tested for predictive validity and found to perform as expected. Applications of the index in strategy research are suggested.

Insights From a Global Perspective	SAGE OPEN												This study examines the drivers of economic complexity for 97 countries over the period 1995 to 2020 by income sub-groups. To investigate determinants of complexity, we develop five novel indexes. Using two-step system GMM (2SGMM) regression with the robust standard errors method, we found that institutional quality, health dimensions and macroeconomic conditions were enormously significant economic complexity drivers. However, the findings vary according to the country groups with different income levels. While the importance of openness and health dimensions are prominent in low and middle-income countries, capital stock and openness are the principal elements in the high-income group. The institutional quality is statistically significant and considerably affects on complexity in each group and across the panel. The education dimension of human capital has a positive effect only in the high-income group and across the panel, while it is negative in the middle and low-income groups, but its effect is weak. Moreover, these findings are valid in the long run. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest that macroeconomic policies focused on institutional quality, openness and healthcare as critical components of economic complexity should be crucial goals, especially for low and middle-income countries.JEL Classification: O11, O43, I15, I25.

Most of the previous measures use a pre-decided context window to define co-occurrence of words. This size is decided from experience, and it is fixed during the whole process of measure. However, this is not ideal because appropriate window size can be different even in two adjacent sentences of a text. This paper provides a novel model called Matrix Plane Model (MPM), which can capture the best-fit window size dynamically and automatically. Also, we set up an experiment to compare MPM with some widely used measures by applying to semantic relatedness measures. The results show that our approach makes significant improvement in performance of semantic relatedness measures.																					978-1-4673-8493-3				2015							1246	1253		10.1109/ICDMW.2015.97	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2015.97													WOS:000380556700168

While there is a large body of research on measuring semantic relatedness in the English language, the literature lacks detailed analysis for these methods in agglutinative languages. In this research, two new evaluation resources for the Turkish language are constructed. An extensive set of experiments involving multiple tasks: word association, semantic categorization, and automatic WordNet relationship discovery are performed to evaluate different semantic relatedness measures in the Turkish language. As Turkish is an agglutinative language, the morphological processing component is important for distributional similarity algorithms. For languages with rich morphological variations and productivity, methods ranging from simple stemming strategies to morphological disambiguation exists. In our experiments, different morphological processing methods for the Turkish language are investigated.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-75477-2; 978-3-319-75476-5				2018	9623		I				600	611		10.1007/978-3-319-75477-2_43	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75477-2_43													WOS:000540380100043
J	Roos, G				Roos, Goran			Knowledge management, intellectual capital, structural holes, economic complexity and national prosperity	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to tie together the insights from the body of research relating to economic complexity theory, structural holes, non-price based competition, and knowledge management. The insights relating to generating national prosperity are synthesised through an intellectual capital lens. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses literature review combined with insights from an Australian project on state-based economic complexity. Findings - The connectivist and autopoietic epistemological paradigms are found to be most aligned with the need to manage transformation between organisational and human resources that will achieve causal ambiguity and hence inimitability. This inimitability forms the basis for achieving non-price based competition and if there is a rich network of economic agents that, both individually and collectively through collaboration, have these characteristics a large share of the economy can operate on the basis of non-priced based competition. If all these agents have an export focus the economic complexity of the economy will be high, and likely increasing, which will enable both the creation and the appropriation of large amounts of value and hence result in increasing national prosperity. Research limitations/implications - Findings are only relevant for OECD countries given the origins of the data used. Practical implications - Managerial implications are outlined as are major implications for public policy. Originality/value - This is the first time that these concepts are linked.

We find that relatedness favours incremental innovations that reuse already applied combinations, whereas increasing levels of relatedness reduce the likelihood of novelty. However, the impact is less negative when combined technologies are new, unrelated or not locally specialized because it facilitates learning and technological recombination. We also find that universities and large incumbents are less dependent on relatedness than small and novel players to create novelty.

Evidence from Italy	INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION												An emerging stream of entrepreneurship studies is debating how knowledge composition influences the capacity of territories to give birth to new firms. This paper aims to study the dynamics linking new firm formation and relatedness. Some studies demonstrate that proximity between different but related sectors positively influences new firms formation. Others point out how the presence of unrelated sectors can have a more significant impact. This paper studies these dynamics across 27 individual industries, computing measures of external and internal relatedness for each sector in Italy, using data on new firm formation between 2012 and 2014. The results suggest the broadly positive impact of external relatedness on new firm formation when compared to the impact of internal relatedness. The sectoral study of the impact of relatedness on new business creation could increase policymakers' awareness of the capacity of individual sectors to promote favourable path-creation trajectories at the micro-level.

TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY												The objective of this study is to scrutinize the major drivers of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in an augmented model framework. The roles of eco-innovation, economic complexity, institutions, and globalization are examined in the context of two sets of heterogeneous panel observations, namely the G7 and E7 countries from 1991 to 2017. The estimated results obtained from the Fully Modified Least Square, Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares, and Canonical Correlation Regression demonstrate the effectiveness of eco-innovation in reducing the intensity of energy use in G7 countries. Eco-innovation is also found to be beneficial for controlling carbon emissions in G7 countries. In contrast, the impact of eco-innovation on the E7 countries is harmful as far as energy efficiency and carbon emissions are concerned. Such contrasting behaviors across the two panel sets of observations validate the postulation of the "rebound effects" of environmental-related technologies in the latter group. The findings further indicate the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic complexity and carbon emissions for G7 countries. In contrast, the E7 countries experience a U-shaped relationship. Both institutions and globalization are significant determinants of environmental quality in G7 and E7 countries. There is an urgency to reinforce the commitment towards the application of eco-technology for efficiency in energy use in G7 countries. As far as the E7 countries are concerned, the governments should optimize the gains from globalization to develop energy efficiency and carbon abatement strategies.

Using trade data from 1995 to 2012, livestock commodity exports are classified based on technology intensity. Employing a method of reflection in computing the economic complexity of export products, we find that one fifth of African livestock commodity exports are manufactured with low technology while the rest is composed of raw materials. The results also show that the ten most complex livestock commodities represent about a third of African livestock total exports while the world level is almost double this figure. Yet African countries spend a huge share of their wealth on importing complex products. The results imply that by exporting non-complex products Africa loses nearly a third of the total value of its livestock exports. To boost the value of livestock products, African countries should exploit their untapped potential while securing the domestic market to achieve import substitution. This can be done by integrating with global value chains or developing niche markets at the regional or international markets and improving productive capabilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact of Network Topology on Systemic Risk and Collapse of Complex Economic Systems	COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS												Economic interdependencies have become increasingly present in globalized production, financial and trade systems. While establishing interdependencies among economic agents is crucial for the production of complex products, they may also increase systemic risk due to failure propagation. It is crucial to identify how network connectivity impacts both the emergent production and risk of collapse of economic systems. In this paper we propose a model to study the effects of network structure on the behavior of economic systems by varying the density and centralization of connections among agents. The complexity of production increases with connectivity given the combinatorial explosion of parts and products. Emergent systemic risks arise when interconnections increase vulnerabilities. Our results suggest a universal description of economic collapse given in the emergence of tipping points and phase transitions in the relationship between network structure and risk of individual failure. This relationship seems to follow a sigmoidal form in the case of increasingly denser or centralized networks. The model sheds new light on the relevance of policies for the growth of economic complexity, and highlights the trade-off between increasing the potential production of the system and its robustness to collapse. We discuss the policy implications of intervening in the organization of interconnections and system features, and stress how different network structures and node characteristics suggest different directions in order to promote complex and robust economic systems.

Central to this approach is an ontology-based representation of text, which captures the level of relatedness between consecutive sentences via ontologies. Our method encompasses annotating text using ontological concepts and assessing text coherence based on relatedness measurement among these concepts. The ontology-based relatedness measurement method used in this study considers various types of relationships in ontologies and derived relationships via an inference engine for computing relatedness. We hypothesized that rich variety of relationships and inferred facts in ontologies would improve the success of text coherence assessment. Our results demonstrate that the use of ontologies yields to coherence values that have a higher correlation with human ratings.

We find that sample firms steadily increased diversification. Despite the increase, the relatedness of their business measured in three ways based on the Japanese IO table stayed essentially constant. Regression results show that the average relationship between diversification and firm performance is negative. Firms can mitigate the negative impact of diversification on profitability by confining diversification to industries that are closely related to their main business. However, this effect of relatedness is insignificant for firm value (Tobin's Q), suggesting that the profitability increase due to greater relatedness does not last long. Consistently, a wide range of diversified firms restructured themselves in the late 1990s by divesting business units.																			0889-1583					SEP	2007	21	3					303	323		10.1016/j.jjie.2006.06.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jjie.2006.06.002													WOS:000250063200001

By differentiating the organizational process of resource integration pertaining to market- versus technology-driven innovation via acquisitions, we show that product market relatedness and technology relatedness have differential effects on postacquisition innovation performance, depending on the size of the acquirer. Our analysis of acquisitions in high-tech industries indicates that larger firms maximize their postacquisition technological innovation performance at a lower level of technology relatedness and, in contrast, at a higher level of product market relatedness, whereas the opposite is true for smaller firms. This study contributes to the acquisitions research by identifying (a) market-driven innovation via acquisitions and (b) different mechanisms through which product market and technological resources affect postacquisition technological innovation.																			0149-2063	1557-1211				NOV	2016	42	7					1934	1963		10.1177/0149206314535439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314535439													WOS:000384829800007

The relationship between skill relatedness and structural change varies across different regions.

However, despite the potential benefits of green finance in addressing climate change, there has been relatively little empirical work on its impact due to the lack of available data. This study aims to fill this gap by empirically analyzing the impact of green finance on the environment using panel data from thirteen complex economies from 2006 to 2020. This study employed a range of econometric techniques, including Driscoll-Kraay standard error and other robustness test models, to explore the relationships between ecological footprint, economic complexity index, green finance, technological in-novations, and political risk. The study found that green finance and technological innovations effectively reduce the ecological footprint by 0.28% and 0.75%, respectively, and could help achieve a sustainable environment. However, economic complexity and political risk upsurge the ecological footprint by 0.75% and 0.78%, respectively, in the selected countries. Finally, depending on the empirical outputs, this paper suggested that governments should take action to reduce carbon footprints and protect the environment by investing in green finance projects, promoting economic diversity and technological sophistication, and creating a stable political environment.

For this purpose, we used data from 4-digit ISIC manufacturing sectors from 28 countries, including 15 developed and 13 developing countries for the period, 2010 to 2019. Using the panel data method, the effect of industry complexity on the degree of inefficiency for each country has been estimated. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method has been used to estimate the inefficiency index in each industry. The result shows that the relationship between the inefficiency degree and the level of industry complexity in developed countries is hump-shaped, and in developing countries is U-shaped. The findings show that the inefficiency degree in developed countries decreases from the level of industrial complexity threshold of -0.53, while in developing countries increases from -0.19. Therefore, developing countries have a comparative advantage in industries whose level of complexity have in the range of -3 to -0.19 and developed countries in the range of -0.53 to +3. In the case of products whose complexity index is between -0.19 and -0.53, their comparative advantage is unclear.

However, word senses are not disambiguated in the training phase of both Word2Vec and GloVe, two famous word embedding algorithms, and the path length between any two senses of words in lexical databases cannot reflect their true semantic relatedness. In this paper, a novel approach that linearly combines Word2Vec and GloVe with the lexical database WordNet is proposed for measuring semantic relatedness. The experiments show that the simple method outperforms the state-of-the-art model SensEmbed.																					978-1-4503-4144-8				2016							73	74		10.1145/2872518.2889395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2889395													WOS:000687202100035
J	Romero, JP; Gramkow, C				Romero, Joao P.; Gramkow, Camila			Economic complexity and greenhouse gas emissions	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it provides evidence that economic complexity contributes to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity as well as per capita emissions. It is argued that the production of complex goods is associated with lower emission intensity due to the types of technologies used in the production of such goods and their high value-added characteristic. Using data for 67 countries between 1976 and 2012, the tests reported in the paper suggest that an increase of 0.1 in the economic complexity index generates a 2% decrease in next period's emissions of kilotons of CO(2)e per billion dollars of output as well as in emissions per capita. Second, the paper proposes a Product Emission Intensity Index (PEII) associated with the production of 786 goods. The index is a weighted average of the emissions of the countries that export each given product with revealed comparative advantage. This index makes it possible to analyse specifically what products are associated with higher emission intensities, contributing to the formulation of policies aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shifting production away from high-emission intensity products as much as possible. The index corroborates that complex products are associated with lower emission intensities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bournakis, I				Bournakis, Ioannis			Costs, knowledge and market structure: understanding the puzzle of international competitiveness with Greek export data	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF APPLIED ECONOMICS												This is an analysis of the sources of international competitiveness with Greek export data for the period 1987-2007. The framework used in the study incorporates factors that do not only represent cost competitiveness but also shed light on the determinants of economic complexity. Economic complexity is the amount of knowledge capabilities embodied in exports that indicates - as a source of comparative advantage - the ability for product differentiation and product variety. The empirical analysis shows that industries benefit substantially from their own R&D activity but, owing to weak economic complexity in the country, there are no cross-industry knowledge spillovers (both at national and international level) that can benefit export activity. Greek exports were found to be sensitive to relative unit labour costs (RULC) but the most important export component of this index is relative labour productivity and not labour cost. Not all institutional arrangements have the same impact on exports, for example high trade union density might harm competitiveness but this factor is uncorrelated with R&D investment. In the view of these findings, Greece's route to international competitiveness should be primarily by improving its economic complexity, making sure that the country specialises in productive activities that enrich its knowledge capabilities as well as increase the potential of knowledge transfer.

We study the relatedness in the adoption of two innovation types and how it could be conditioned by the presence/absence of the remaining innovation types. In order to do this we develop a new methodological approach for testing conditional relatedness. The empirical study uses the Spanish Community Innovation Survey (2008-2014). Our results show that, contrary to the traditional approach that suggests a strong relatedness between product and process innovations, this is the less intense link found. Our empirical approach also allows us to confirm that product innovation emerges as a fundamental axis in the innovation strategy because the more intensively used innovation strategies are those combining product innovation with any other innovation type in absence of the rest and those combining any of the other three innovation types in presence of product innovation. These results provide implications for further research, top management and innovation strategy development.

J	Wang, Q; Yang, T; Li, RR				Wang, Qiang; Yang, Ting; Li, Rongrong			Economic complexity and ecological footprint: The role of energy structure, industrial structure, and labor force	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Existing studies show the important influence of economic complexity index (ECI) on environmental quality, but do not consider the mediating effect of other key factors on the relationship between the two, thus ignoring the structural break and nonlinear characteristics of the relationship between ECI and environmental quality. To fill this research gap, this study constructs a decomposition framework and multiple panel threshold regression models based on an extended STIRPAT model using panel data from 36 OECD countries to explore the nonlinear relationship between ECI and ecological footprint (an indicator of environmental quality) in terms of three key mediators: energy consumption structure, industrial structure, and human capital. The results show that a 1% increase in economic complexity is associated with a 0.075% increase in ecological footprint per capita, and an increase in economic complexity is detrimental to environmental improvement. When energy consumption structure is used as the threshold variable, the correlation coefficient between ECI and ecological footprint per capita gradually shifts from positive to negative with an inverted U-shaped curve as the share of renewable energy consumption increases. In particular, when the share of renewable energy consumption is higher than 44.56%, ECI shows a negative correlation with ecological footprint, i.e., ECI promotes the improvement of environmental quality. When the industrial structure is used as the threshold variable, the coefficient change from the below-threshold stage to the above-threshold stage indicates that the reduction of per capita ecological footprint shrinks from 0.161% to 0.102% for each 1% increase in ECI. The increase in the human capital index suppresses the positive effect of ECI on the ecological footprint per capita, i.e., the technology effect mitigates the environmental pressure caused by ECI, and only a country with a human capital index above 2.60 is in the interval where the technology effect comes into play. Finally, targeted policy recommendations from the perspective of the energy structure, industrial structure, and labor force are proposed to mitigate the effects of economic complexity on environmental quality.

However, alongside such robust economic growth performances, the environmental qualities in these countries have simultaneously aggravated to raise deep concerns among the stakeholders. Hence, this study is designed to empirically examine the environmental effects of nuclear and renewable energy consumption, economic complexity, and economic growth in the context of the G7 countries for the period between 1995 and 2016. To ensure novelty, this study considers carbon footprints along with carbon dioxide emissions to measure environmental quality in the context of the G7 nations. The results reveal that although nuclear energy consumption is effective in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions and carbon footprints in the long run, renewable energy consumption degrades the environment in the G7 countries. Besides, the results also suggest that the G7 countries can transform their production processes in an environmentally friendly manner provided they can undergo a clean transition in energy use. Finally, economic growth is evidenced to be detrimental for the environment since higher economic growth levels are seen to boost both carbon dioxide emission and carbon footprint levels. Therefore, in line with the findings, this study recommends the G7 countries to significantly enhance their nuclear and renewable energy consumption levels, increase their economic complexity indices, and integrate environmental welfare policies within their economic growth strategies.

A total of 461 students completed the questionnaire which consisted of five scales assessing attitudes towards filial piety, perceived scholastic competence, perceived autonomous support from parents, relatedness with parents and academic motivation. By using structural equation modelling, a predictive model of academic motivation, with filial piety, competence, autonomy, relatedness, age and gender as antecedents, was developed. All variables explained the prediction of academic motivation, with competence acted as the strongest effect, followed by relatedness and filial piety. The findings highlight the important contribution of the three self-determination theory (SDT) components and the value of filial piety for Chinese adolescents' academic motivation. The implications of the findings for future research and educational practice were discussed.

This study aims to investigate how different factors affect the ecological footprint in 50 major complex economies. The study undertakes an extended STIRPAT equation with data from 1990 to 2018. The STIRPAT equation allows us to test the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and explore the impact of renewable energy use, technology, population, and natural resources. The study utilizes several second-generation econometric techniques such as augmented mean group, mean group, and common correlated effect mean group estimation techniques and a second-generation panel causality test. The outcome of the study reveals the existence of the EKC in these complex economies. Economic complexity, clean energy consumption, and population density have a significant negative impact on ecological footprint, whereas natural resources reveal insignificant impacts. The research concludes with policy suggestions for achieving sustainable development in these major complex countries.

Using China's international trade data, this paper measures product-scale market relatedness and explores the impact of market relatedness on two-fold export dynamics, that is the entry of new products and the opening of new overseas markets. Our results show that the entry of new products may be driven by two kinds of power (supply-side relatedness and demand-side relatedness) at the same time. New products with strong market relatedness to locally-available products are more likely to enter the city's production network. However, strong market relatedness between products may result in path locking in overseas market expansion. In terms of mechanisms, product entry and overseas market exploitation are conditioned by the degree of the city's market competition and external demand, respectively.

Three types of occupational relatedness were examined: local synergy-, complementarity- and similarity-relatedness densities. Local synergy- and complementarity-relatedness densities were most closely associated with regional branching, and were more relevant to preventing the decline of specializations than promoting the emergence of new ones. All types of relatedness were more closely associated with preventing the disappearance of occupations from the most backward regions.

The matrix of countries and exported products shows a marked triangular structure instead of the block-diagonal structure expected from Ricardian arguments of specialization. This observation points to the fact that diversification is instead the dominant effect in the globalized market. We discuss how to define a suitable non-monetary metrics for the value of diversification and the effective complexity of products. We discuss in detail the previous proposed approaches to assess this challenge and their limitations.

J	Lee, KH; Mauer, DC; Xu, EQ				Lee, Kyeong Hun; Mauer, David C.; Xu, Emma Qianying			Human capital relatedness and mergers and acquisitions	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS												We construct a measure of the pairwise relatedness of firms' human capital to examine whether human capital relatedness is a key factor in mergers and acquisitions. We find that mergers are more likely and merger returns and postmerger performance are higher when firms have related human capital. These relations are stronger or only present in acquisitions where the merging firms do not operate in the same industries or product markets. Reductions in employment and wages following mergers with high human capital relatedness suggest that the merged firm has greater ability to layoff low quality and/or duplicate employees and reduce labor costs. We further show in a falsification test that human capital relatedness has no effect on acquiring firm returns in asset sales when little or no labor is transferred, which helps validate our measure of human capital relatedness.

This article develops an integrated framework to elucidate how the combination of technological relatedness and product relatedness between acquiring and target firms affects post-innovation performance of technology-driven M&As. This performance is investigated by using a set of parameters, namely R&D input, patent and product activity, and the financial results from commercialisation. We conducted case studies on China's high-tech firms derived from three diverse industry sectors, and the empirical results indicate that both types of relatedness between the partners of technology-driven M&As are conducive to the intensification of R&D expenditures. The acquisition of similar technologies and products has more significant effects on R&D input and output, and M&As without technology relatedness have better financial performance, since they lead acquirers to new technology sectors or sub-sectors. In comparison, M&As with technological complementarity and product complementarity have negative effects on related innovation processes in the short term.

The proposed measures adopt the shortest path between synsets in WordNet as the core to measure the relatedness between two sentences. The interlinked synsets in WordNet are based on the conceptual-semantic relation between two synsets. Thus the distance between two synsets in WordNet can be used to measure the semantic relatedness between two synsets. This study derived a sentence-level semantic relatedness using this feature to detect paraphrasing among sentences. The performance of the proposed semantic relatedness in paraphrasing is evaluated based on the accuracy and F-measures of the proposed measures in identifying paraphrase in Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus. The proposed method achieved 71.1% in accuracy and 81.8% in F-measures. The performance of the proposed method is compared with 6 paraphrase detection methods which include Salient Semantic Analysis and Second-order Co-occurrence Pointwise Mutual Information. In the comparison, the proposed method achieved the fourth highest accuracy and the second highest F-measure compare to other methods. This is a reasonable performance for the proposed semantic relatedness in paraphrase detection.

JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION												This is the first study to examine the effect of productive capacities on economic complexity and understand whether the Aid for Trade (AfT) flows is important for this effect in recipient countries. The analysis uses a sample of 126 developed and developing countries for 2002-2018 and adopts the two-step system Generalized Method of Moments approach. Results show that strengthening productive capacities enhances economic complexity. Furthermore, productive capacities and total AfT flows are strongly complementary in positively affecting economic complexity, and the degree of complementarity is higher for poor countries than for other AfT-recipient countries. Similarly, productive capacities are strongly complementary with total Non-AfT flows, as well as for total development aid. These findings highlight the need for scaling-up development aid flows, notably AfT flows, in favor of developing countries and poor countries having the lowest levels of productive capacities.																			1225-651X	1976-5525				DEC	2021	36	4					626	688		10.11130/jei.2021.36.4.626	http://dx.doi.org/10.11130/jei.2021.36.4.626													WOS:000725285500004
J	Fitjar, RD; Timmermans, B				Fitjar, Rune Dahl; Timmermans, Bram			Relatedness and the Resource Curse: Is There a Liability of Relatedness?	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												Literature in evolutionary economic geography has emphasized knowledge spillover benefits of co-location with related industries. We draw on resource curse literature to demonstrate that relatedness also comes with costs in the form of labor market competition. Using a case study of a growth period in the Norwegian petroleum industry, we show that this had positive as well as negative implications for related industries. Industries related to petroleum grew faster than unrelated industries over the period. However, they also suffered from high labor costs and loss of human capital. Related industries had to pay higher wages than unrelated industries, even after controlling for worker characteristics. Furthermore, several of their employees, in particular the most productive ones, left for the petroleum industry. The relationship between petroleum and related industries is asymmetric insofar as workers tend to leave related industries for petroleum at higher rates than vice versa. Furthermore, the petroleum industry recruits the most productive workers from related industries and returns its least productive workers. Overall, this could potentially lead to de-skilling in related industries, which could more than outweigh any potential knowledge spillover benefits from their relatedness to the petroleum industry. Consequently, we argue that relatedness is not an even playing field: there may be losers, as well as winners, from relatedness.

J	Pirrò, G				Pirro, Giuseppe			Building relatedness explanations from knowledge graphs	SEMANTIC WEB												Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a key ingredient to complement search results, discover entities and their relations and support several knowledge discovery tasks. We face the problem of building relatedness explanations, that is, graphs that can explain how a pair of entities is related in a KG. Explanations can be used in a variety of tasks; from exploratory search to query answering. We formalize the notion of explanation and present two algorithms. The first, E4D (Explanations from Data), assembles explanations starting from all paths interlinking the source and target entity in the data. The second algorithm E4S (Explanations from Schema) builds explanations focused on a specific relatedness perspective expressed by providing a predicate. E4S first generates candidate explanation patterns at the level of schema; then, it assembles explanations by proceeding to their verification in the data. Given a set of paths, found by E4D or E4S, we describe different criteria to build explanations based on information-theory, diversity, and their combination. As a concrete use-case of relatedness explanations, we introduce relatedness-based KG querying, which revisits the query-by-example paradigm from the perspective of relatedness explanations. We implemented all the machinery in the RECAP tool, which is based on RDF and SPARQL. We discuss an evaluation of the explanation building algorithms and a comparison of RECAP with related systems on real-world data.

The proposed algorithm WLA focuses on the hyperlink structure and summary paragraph extracted from the topic pages to compute two terms similarity. Comparing with other similar techniques, the approach is less computationally intensive, because only the first paragraph is analyzed, not the entire text.

Computing semantic similarity between two entities is a non-trivial task. There are many ways to define semantic similarity. Some measures have been proposed combining both statistical information and lexical similarity. It is difficult for a measure that performs well in a given domain to be applied with accuracy in another domain. A similarity measure may perform better with one language than another. Word is supposed to be not only similar to itself but also to some of its synonyms in a given context, and some words with common roots. Our approach is designed to perform query matching and compute semantic relatedness using word occurrences. It performs better than classical measures like TF-IDF, Cosine etc. Although it is not a metric, the proposed similarity measure can be used for a wide range of content analysis tasks based on semantic distance and its efficacy has been demonstrated. The measure is not corpus dependent so it can establish directly the se-mantic relatedness of two entities.																					978-1-4799-4419-4				2014							1	5																WOS:000380428800001

The empirical relevance of the main arguments is tested by estimating the effects of related and unrelated variety in education and occupation among employees, as well as in industries, on regional growth. The results show that occupational and educational related variety are positively correlated with productivity growth, which supports the conceptual discussion put forth in the paper.

In this paper, we study how differentiation and market alignment at the offering level impact firm performance. To that end, we mine firms' 10-K filings to characterise the portfolio of offerings through the lens of outward relatedness, inward relatedness, and digitisation. We define outward relatedness as a measure of alignment of firm offerings within its market space, inward relatedness as a measure of differentiation of firm offerings with its own past offerings, and digitisation as a measure of the firm's focus on IT. We find that markets react positively to firms that operate with high levels of outward relatedness, low levels of inward relatedness and high levels of digitisation. However, we find that highly digitised firms do not have to conform to peers' offerings. Digitisation enables these firms to differentiate by internally diversifying their offerings. Interestingly, our results show that only firms already highly digitised benefit from further digitisation.

Econometric Analysis of the Impact of the Intensity of Transboundary Activities on the Level of Economic Complexity: The Case Study of European Countries	REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES												Introduction. Development of countries, regions and individual ecosystems occurs in the paradigm of innovative and technological change, the crucial element being the production knowledge and competencies. Their ranging in terms of transforming the complexity of the products that the country exports has been embodied and developed in the approach of economic complexity. However, insufficient attention is paid to the study of economic complexity in the context of transboundary processes that impact the development of terntories. The objective of this study is to measure the impact of the intensity of transboundary relations on the change in economic complexity through the case study of European countries using the indicators of transboundary specialization of foreign trade turnover. Materials and Methods. The study employed the methods of econometric analysis. Information from the UN Comtrade database, as well as from the special resources for analyzing the economic complexity of countries, the Atlas of Economic Complexity and the Observatory of Economic Complexity, was used as the source data for calculations and measurements. Results. European countries have been classified into 3 subpanels based on Gaussian mixture distributions. The intensity of the impact of the transboundary activities on the complexity of the economy has been identified employing the panel cointegration method based on the constructed models (the combined model and models with fixed and random effects), which were supplemented by data analysis using the fully modified least squares method and the dynamic least squares method. Long-term interdependence between economic complexity and the intensity of transboundary activities has been identified. Discussion and Conclusion. It has been established that the influence of the transboundary interaction factor weakens as the economic complexity increases and under certain conditions it has a negative impact. The revealed dependence is due to the increasing role of global processes rather than the transboundary ones as the economy becomes more complex and more oriented towards the global market. The research findings contribute to further development of the Theory of Economic Complexity; they significantly expand the practical scope of its application, play an important role in understanding and further research on the opportunities and limitations for the development of territories differing in the transboundary cooperation intensity.																			2413-1407	2587-8549				OCT-DEC	2019	27	4					602	632		10.15507/2413-1407.109.027.201904.602-632	http://dx.doi.org/10.15507/2413-1407.109.027.201904.602-632													WOS:000593219200001

Atlas of economic complexity, Russian regional pages	VOPROSY EKONOMIKI												Well-established results indicate that export diversification might be a better growth strategy for an emerging economy as long as its GDP per capita level is smaller than an empirically defined threshold. As average incomes in Russian regions are likely to be far below the threshold, it might be important to estimate their diversification potential. The paper discusses the Atlas of economic complexity for Russian regions created to visualize regional export baskets, to estimate their complexity and evaluate regional export potential. The paper's results are consistent with previous findings: the complexity of export is substantially higher and diversification potential is larger in western and central regions of Russia. Their export potential might become larger if western and central regions, first, try to join global value added chains and second, cooperate and develop joint diversification strategies. Northern and eastern regions are by contrast much less complex and their diversification potential is small.

Higher cognitive relatedness between bachelor and master leads to better -predictive validity of bachelor grades during admission	ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION												Prospective graduate students are usually required to have attained an undergraduate degree in a related field and high prior grades to gain admission. There is consensus that some relatedness between the students' undergraduate and graduate programs is required for admission. We propose a new measurement for this relatedness using cosine similarity, a method that has been tried and tested in fields such as bibliometric sciences and economic geography. We used this measurement to calculate the relatedness between a student's undergraduate and graduate program, and tested the effect of this measure on study success. Our models show that there is an interaction effect between undergraduate grades and cognitive relatedness on graduate grades. For bachelor students with high cognitive relatedness, the relationship between bachelor grades and master grades is about twice as strong compared to bachelor students with low cognitive relatedness. This is an important finding because it shows that undergraduate grades, the most common admission instrument in higher education, have limited usefulness for students with relatively unrelated undergraduate programs. Admissions officers need to carefully assess their admission instruments for such students and rely less on grades when it comes to the decision to admit students.					van Rijnsoever, Frank J/L-6628-2013														0260-2938	1469-297X				OCT 3	2023	48	7					966	979		10.1080/02602938.2022.2158453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2022.2158453		DEC 2022											WOS:000905262200001

The studied region has an important feature of less industrialization and are having high advantage of biodiversity. As ecological footprint is a comprehensive indicator of environmental deterioration because it assesses the impact of all human activities on nature. This research examines the effect of economic complexity and the natural resources rents on the per capita ecological footprint in Latin America. To assess the sensitivity of the parameters and to capture the impact of the growth in the structure of the industrial sector for the region, the study includes globalization, inequality, internal credit and trade as additional covariates. The theoretical framework comprises the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and for the methodology the quantile regression approach, proposed by Canay (2011), Powell (2016) and Machado and Santos Silva (2019), has been used in this study. The study found that the impact of economic complexity and the natural resources rents is heterogeneous throughout the distribution on the ecological footprint. It is also observed that the level of inequality for the utilization of region-specific climatic distribution of natural resources, increases the ecological footprint in the lower quantiles, while in the upper quantiles, it decreases the same. This study provides a new approach to analyze the degradation of environment in countries with high dependence on natural resources rents and highincome inequality.

J	Solarin, SA; Al-Mulali, U				Solarin, Sakiru Adebola; Al-Mulali, Usama			Transportation fuel subsidies and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: The roles of economic complexity and uncertainty	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY												Transportation fuel subsidies have been rising in several developing countries. In order to broaden our understanding of transportation fuel subsidies, many attempts have been made in the literature to investigate the impact of the transportation fuel subsidies. This is mostly because exposing the various negative effects of transportation fuel subsidies might stimulating the appropriate authorities to act against the growing transportation fuel subsidies. However, the impact of transportation fuel subsidies on pollution has not been adequately examined in the literature. This study investigates the determinants of environmental degradation with a focus on the role of transportation fuel subsidies in selected developing countries. The control variables considered in this study include economic complexity and uncertainty, which have not been sufficiently examined in the existing literature. Pollution from transport sector is used as an indicator of environmental degradation. The study adopts a dynamic panel data method, which offers more reliable results relative to analyses done via conventional methods. The empirical findings suggest that an increase in transportation fuel subsidies generate a rise in transportation sector CO2 emissions. Specifically, a 1% rise in transportation fuel subsidies per capita will increase the transport sector CO2 emissions by between 0.041% and 0.094%. The results further illustrate that an increase in population, real gross domestic product per capita or uncertainty raises environmental degradation, while a rise in economic complexity reduces environmental degradation. It is observed that the impact of transport oil subsidies per capita is less pronounced in countries with higher per capita income.

In this paper, we creatively propose the aspect-based semantic relatedness, and we present a novel metaphor interpretation method based on semantic relatedness for context-dependent nominal metaphors. First, we obtain the possible comprehension aspects according to the properties of source domain. Then, combined with contextual information, we calculate the degree of relatedness between the target and source domains from different aspects. Finally, we select the aspect which makes the relatedness between target and source domains maximum as comprehension aspect, and the metaphor explanation is formed with corresponding property of source domain. The results show that our method has higher accuracy. In particular, when the information of target domain is insufficient in corpus, our method still exhibits the good performance.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-25207-0; 978-3-319-25206-3				2015	9362						182	193		10.1007/978-3-319-25207-0_16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25207-0_16													WOS:000380773500016

The nature of CVM is the combination of word vectors, wherefore the representation method for words is essential for CVM. A computational study is performed in this paper to compare the effects of the newly proposed word representation methods embedded in CVM. The experimental results demonstrate that some of the newly proposed word representation methods significantly improve the performance of CVM, for they estimate the relatedness between words better.

We will show that existing semantic relatedness measures might not be directly applicable to microblogging content such as tweets due to i) the informality and short length of microblogging content, which can lead to shift in the meaning of words when used in microblog posts, ii) the presence of non-dictionary words that have their semantics defined/evolved by the Twitter community. Therefore, we propose the Twitter Space Semantic Relatedness (TSSR) technique that relies on the latent relation hypothesis to measure semantic relatedness of words on Twitter. We construct a graph representation of terms in tweets and apply a random walk procedure to produce a stationary distribution for each word, which is the basis for relatedness calculation. Our experiments examine TSSR from three different perspectives and show that TSSR is better suited for Twitter analytics compared to the standard semantic relatedness techniques.

We contribute to the literature on determinants of output volatility with a relatively new index on productive capabilities of export goods, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), developed by Hausmann et al. [Hausmann, R., C. A. Hidalgo, S. Bustos, M. Coscia, A. Simoes, and M. A. Yildirim. 2014. The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity. MIT Press]. The ECI measures the productive capabilities of countries by explaining the knowledge accumulated in a population based on the goods produced and exported and to which countries they export. Therefore ECI captures diversification as well as the technology embedded in the products. Using panel data analysis for a cross section of countries from 1984 to 2016, we find variations in the effects of ECI on output volatility between high and low income countries. For high income countries, increases in ECI reduce output volatility in the short to medium term with a longer delay in output volatility moderation for low income countries. Findings suggest that low income countries have less diversified and less complex export goods which leave them open to external shocks and reduce their ability to adjust quickly to the shocks. Furthermore, disaggregation by regions reveals that economic complexity in Asia is relatively more effective at reducing output volatility than in Africa.

This paper presents new evidence on the transformation, geography and industrial relatedness of creative service exports in the UK, using the Inquiry in International Trade in Services (ITIS) database. Creative services exports have grown over the past decade, but there are pronounced patterns of geographical specialization in the export of creative and non-creative services. We develop a measure of relatedness between exports of creative and non-creative services and of manufacturing goods. We argue that creative services are economically significant because of their interrelationship with other local sectors.

Using the episodes iden-tified by Libman et al.

To visualise this structure, we use the spatial relatedness network of the global international migration system. Unlike traditional spatial networks based on real spatial interactions, spatial relatedness networks are based on possible relationships which are determined as a degree of agreement between the maps of the analysed phenomena. In this paper, the spatial relatedness network of the global migration system is conceptualised as an undirected network in which nodes represent individual migrant groups defined by the country of origin, and links between nodes correspond to their spatial relatedness in terms of similarity in their spatial distributions. We describe the construction of the network and explore some of its properties such as the clustering of migrant groups that share similar positions in the global migration system, signifying distinct spatial regimes of migrants' destination choices.

Moreover, this paper introduced legitimacy from the perspective of institutional theory and found that both acquisition experience and business relatedness have positive influence on acquisition legitimacy. It is proved that acquisition legitimacy has partial mediation effect both on the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance and on the relationship between business relatedness and acquisition performance, which means acquisition experience and business relatedness can increase acquisition performance not only by integration effect of acquisition but also by gaining more support with getting high legitimacy.																					978-0-9800510-7-0				2014							236	243																WOS:000345178500031

In such applications, the notion of relatedness between entities plays an important role whenever, given a query, we are looking not only for exact answers but we are also interested in a ranked list of related ones. In this paper we present an approach to build a relatedness graph among resources in the DBpedia dataset that refer to the IT domain. Our final aim is to create a useful data structure at the basis of an expert system that, looking for an IT resource, returns a ranked list of related technologies, languages, tools the user might be interested in. The graph we created is a basic building block to allow an expert system to support the user in entity search tasks in the IT domain (e.g. software component search or expert finding) that goes beyond string matching typical of pure keyword-based approaches and is able to exploit the explicit and implicit semantics encoded within LOD datasets. The graph creation relies on different relatedness measures that are combined with each other to compute a ranked list of candidate resources associated to a given query. We validated our tool through experimental evaluation on real data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Equivalence between the Fitness-Complexity and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithms	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY												We uncover the connection between the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, developed in the economic complexity field, and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, widely used in diverse domains ranging from computer science and mathematics to economics. Despite minor formal differences between the two methods, both converge to the same fixed-point solution up to normalization. The discovered connection allows us to derive a rigorous interpretation of the Fitness and the Complexity metrics as the potentials of a suitable energy function. Under this interpretation, high-energy products are unfeasible for low-fitness countries, which explains why the algorithm is effective at displaying nested patterns in bipartite networks. We also show that the proposed interpretation reveals the scale invariance of the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, which has practical implications for the algorithm's implementation in different datasets. Further, analysis of empirical trade data under the new perspective reveals three categories of countries that might benefit from different development strategies.

Moreover, this research attempts to discover the determinants of ECI in the globalization wave. Design/methodology - Our empirical model considers the relationship between ECI and the level of development in middle- and high-income economies from 1995 to 2010 by using systemic qualitative analysis, including OLS, fixed-effects, and system GMM. Next, this research used OLS regression to find the determinants of ECI. In particular, we compared the effects of different factors on ECI in the different development stages. Findings - Our main findings can be summarized as follows: 1. If the ECI increases by 1, it could lead to an increase of about 30% in the level of development in middle- and high-income economies. 2. Human capital plays an important role in the development of and increase in ECI. 3. GVC participation and outflow FDI enhance an increase in ECI, in particular in middle-income economies. 4. The development of manufacturing industries is helpful to increase ECI; however, middle-income economies should pay more attention to their comparative advantage industries. 5. R&D has positive effects on the ECI. Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses systemic qualitative analysis to investigate the relationship between ECI and the level of development. The paper provides suggestions for policy makers to increase ECI under the current wave of globalization, in particular in middle-income economies.

J	Moreno, R; Ocampo-Corrales, D				Moreno, Rosina; Ocampo-Corrales, Diego			The ability of European regions to diversify in renewable energies: The role of technological relatedness	RESEARCH POLICY												Despite the global consensus about the growing significance of renewables, the regional drivers of innovation in these unique and novel technologies have been widely neglected in the literature. In this paper, we show that renewable energy (RE) inventions differ from other green inventions in the knowledge recombination processes leading to their generation as well as in their impact on subsequent inventions. The evidence on these specificities of RE technologies allows us hypothesizing that regional branching in renewables may rely on relatedness differently than other non-RE green technologies. In checking this hypothesis, we use a data set spanning the period 1981-2015 covering 277 European NUTS2 regions in the EU28 countries plus Norway. We obtain that relatedness is highly relevant in explaining regional specialization in RE, and more relevant than for other green technologies, which we associate to the lower generality in their impact and the narrower scope of the knowledge from which they nurture. This conclusion is maintained when considering separately regions with high and low development levels. However, the impact of relatedness increases for RE as the regional economic development decreases, signalling that a low endowment of resources and capabilities does not allow the region to break from its past technological specialization, depending more on relatedness. This would not be the case for other green technologies, probably due to their higher level of generality and wider scope.

New indicators, such as the Economic Complexity Index (i.e., ECI), can be used to predict human development index (i.e., HDI). To be defined as a complex economy, a country, through a vast network of individuals, should be able to interlink extensive quantities of relevant knowledge to create diversified products. Political, cultural, and environmental factors should also be included in this model to improve the measurement of human development. This paper aimed to study the relationship between the ECI and HDI and the mediating effects of income inequality among developing countries. Hierarchical linear modeling was used as a statistical tool to analyze 87 developing countries from 1990 to 2017, which also studied the country-level effects of gender inequality and energy consumption. Different year lags were used for more robustness. The results show that human development increased with higher economic complexity. This relationship was, however, partially mediated by income inequality. Country-level predictors, gender inequality, and energy consumption also impacted sustainable development. Finally, it is essential to note that this model cannot be applied to developed economies.																				2071-1050				MAR 1	2020	12	5							2089	10.3390/su12052089	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12052089													WOS:000522470900390
J	Chen, P				Chen, Ping			Equilibrium Illusion, Economic Complexity and Evolutionary Foundation in Economic Analysis	EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW												It is widely believed that an equilibrium framework based on simple models, such as the representative agent and bilateral bargaining, in a frictionless economy provides a consistent framework in micro, macro, finance, and institutional economics. However, equilibrium believes in self-stabilizing market and institutional convergence broken down when inherent instability and non-predictable uncertainty emerge under nonlinear and social interactions. Equilibrium illusions in economics and econometrics are pretty in math modeling but dangerous in policy decision. Known examples are the Frisch model of noise-driven cycles, the Lucas model of microfoundations, and the Coasian world of zero transactions. These models not only violate basic laws in science but also lack evidence in economic history. Their common problem is associated with linear Hamiltonian economics with symmetric information without history. Economies are dissipative systems in nature, characterized by symmetry breaking, information flow, a time arrow, and history. The many-body problem is fundamentally different from the one-body and two-body problem in mathematics. Both computational and natural experiments, such as a stock market crash and a transitional depression, reveal the severe limitations of equilibrium thinking and structural changes from evolutionary dynamics. The new science of complexity offers new tools of nonlinear dynamics and non-stationary time series analysis. Existing puzzles in equilibrium economics, such as persistent cycles, interruptive crises, market resilience, social movements, and organizational diversity, can be better understood by nonlinear dynamic models. Like the paradigm shift after Einstein in physics, the evolutionary perspective provides a general framework, while equilibrium models serve as its special cases, since the equilibrium picture is an approximation of economic complexity in a short-time window taken from a long-term historical current.																			1349-4961	2188-2096				SEP	2008	5	1					81	127		10.14441/eier.5.81	http://dx.doi.org/10.14441/eier.5.81													WOS:000217361200007

Supply chains and the success of M&As: investigating the effect of structural equivalence of merging firms' supplier and customer bases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT												Purpose This study investigates the extent to which structural equivalence between acquiring and target firms is associated with post-merger and acquisition (M&A) performance-a relationship that is proposed to be moderated by industry-level vertical relatedness between acquiring and target firms. Design/methodology/approach Applying social network analysis and regression, this study analyzes a buyer-supplier relationship network dataset of 279 M&A deals completed between 2010 and 2017 to test the hypotheses. Structural equivalence is measured as the proportion of common customers and suppliers between an acquiring firm and a target firm. Findings Supporting a view about the importance of supply chains in explaining M&As outcomes, the results suggest that the structural equivalence in the supplier network is positively associated with post-M&A firm performance. The results also show that the effect of the structural equivalence in the customer network is moderated by vertical relatedness between two merging firms (i.e. structural equivalence contributes to post-M&A performance when vertical industry relatedness is high). Originality/value This study contributes to the M&A and supply network literature by investigating the performance implications of structural equivalence in supplier and customer networks, demonstrating the importance of taking a supply chain view when explaining M&As outcomes. Specifically, the authors suggest considering structural equivalence as a new type of relatedness between merging firms (i.e. relatedness in network resources in explaining post-M&A performance). It also indicates how industry-level vertical resource relatedness, which is about relatedness in internal resources between the two firms, could interact with firm-level network resource relatedness, which is about relatedness in external supply chain resources between the two firms, in affecting post-M&A performance.

J	Arnaut, M; Dada, JT				Arnaut, Marina; Dada, James Temitope			Exploring the nexus between economic complexity, energy consumption and ecological footprint: new insights from the United Arab Emirates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT												PurposeMotivated by the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-7: clean and affordable energy, SDG-8: sustainable economic growth, SDG-13: climate action), this study aims to investigate the role of economic complexity, disaggregated energy consumption in addition to economic growth, financial development, globalization and urbanization on the ecological footprint of United Arab Emirates (UAE). Design/methodology/approachThis study adopts unit root tests (with and without a structural break), autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test and dynamic ordinary least squares. FindingsThe results obtained from the ARDL model suggest that economic complexity (EC), nonrenewable energy and economic growth increase the ecological footprint in both the short and long run, thus deteriorating the environment. However, renewable energy and urbanization reduce the ecological footprint in UAE during the two periods, thus improving environmental quality. Globalization and financial development have different influences on ecological footprint during these periods. These findings are robust to other estimation techniques. Practical implicationsBased on these results, this study offers significant policy implications such as increasing renewable energy supply, particularly solar energy and aligning the product manufacturing structure and complexity toward producing environmentally friendly products which can be used to realize the nation's agenda of reducing fossil fuels consumption to 38% by 2050 and achieving sustainable environment and growth. Originality/valueThis study provides an empirical attempt to investigate the influence of EC and renewable and nonrenewable energy on the ecological footprint of the UAE.

J	Kannen, P				Kannen, Peter			Does foreign direct investment expand the capability set in the host economy? A sectoral analysis	WORLD ECONOMY												Most empirical studies examining the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic development use aggregate monetary-based measures such as GDP or TFP growth as indicators for development. We deviate from this approach and use instead the recently developed economic complexity index; this measure summarises the complexity of the productive structure of an economy, and its values can be interpreted as the number of capabilities present in a country. These capabilities are units of productive knowledge necessary for the production of goods, and goods differ in the number of necessary capabilities. Furthermore, we use sectoral FDI data to take differences between sectors of an economy into account, since the number of necessary capabilities also varies between the sectors. In our empirical analysis, covering 63 developing and developed countries over the period 2005-14, we find that FDI in the tertiary sector has a statistically significant and robust positive effect on the number of capabilities, whereas FDI in the primary and secondary sectors generally does not increase the capability set of an economy.																			0378-5920	1467-9701				FEB	2020	43	2					428	457		10.1111/twec.12869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.12869		NOV 2019											WOS:000494616700001

Though relatedness and similarity are closely related, they are not the same as illustrated by the words lemon and tea which are related but not similar. The relatedness takes into account a broader ranLemge of relations while similarity only considers subsumption relations to assess how two objects are similar. We present in this paper a method for measuring the semantic similarity of words as a combination of various techniques including knowledge-based and corpus-based methods that capture different aspects of similarity. Our corpus based method exploits state-of-the-art word representations. We performed experiments with a recently published significantly large dataset called Simlex-999 and achieved a significantly better correlation (rho = 0.642, P < 0.001) with human judgment compared to the individual performance.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-18111-0; 978-3-319-18110-3				2015	9041						335	346		10.1007/978-3-319-18111-0_25	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-18111-0_25													WOS:000362441400025

However, the role of emigrants in promoting the productive capacity of their home countries through the diffusion of knowledge and novel technologies has been relatively overlooked. The present study investigated the relationship between emigration stock and productive knowledge embedded in their origin economy, as measured by the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). The study applied a GMM Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) technique to 86 non-high-income countries between 1995 and 2020. In principle, the PVAR model findings indicated that international emigrants promoted the level of technology and knowledge in their home countries. Further causality analyses revealed that within all countries, there was unidirectional causality from emigration to the ECI. However, a bidirectional relationship existed between the two variables in countries with low education levels. Developing countries should consider the opportunities emigrants offer when planning their development strategies.

Among different economic clusters in China, the southern region represents the wealthiest region. Hence, it is essential to conduct an in-depth analysis to explore the region's sustainability in its economy. This paper applies the economic complexity model to 22 major cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area cluster. The study is based on seven industrial sectors.

Several approaches have already been proposed to compute SR based on Wikipedia. Most of the existing approaches use certain kinds of information in Wikipedia (e. g. links, categories, and texts) and compute the SR by empirically designed measures. We have observed that these approaches produce very different results for the same entity pair in some cases. Therefore, how to select appropriate features and measures to best approximate the human judgment on SR becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach for computing SR between entities based on Wikipedia. Given two entities, our approach first maps entities to articles in Wikipedia; then different kinds of features of the mapped articles are extracted from Wikipedia, which are then combined with different relatedness measures to produce nine raw SR values of the entity pair. A supervised learning algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal weights of different raw SR values. The final SR is computed as the weighted average of raw SRs. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods.																			0302-9743		978-3-319-11116-2; 978-3-319-11115-5				2014	8709						236	246																WOS:000345287600021

When it comes to economic systems, it is now well-known that the country-product bipartite network exhibits a nested structure, which is the foundation of different algorithms that have been used to scientifically investigate countries' development and forecast national economic growth. Changing the subject from countries to companies, a significantly different scenario emerges. Through the analysis of a unique dataset of Italian firms' exports and a worldwide dataset comprising countries' exports, here we find that, while a globally nested structure is observed at the country level, a local, in-block nested structure emerges at the level of firms. This in-block nestedness is statistically significant with respect to suitable null models and the algorithmic partitions of products into blocks correspond well with the UN-COMTRADE product classification. These findings lay a solid foundation for developing a scientific approach based on the physics of complex systems to the analysis of companies, which has been lacking until now.					zaccaria, andrea/F-8476-2018															2632-072X				JUN 1	2023	4	2							025011	10.1088/2632-072X/accb35	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-072X/accb35													WOS:000989223300001
J	Beyene, AB				Beyene, Amsalu Bedemo			Income inequality and economic complexity in Africa: the moderating role of governance quality	COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES												This study examines the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality in 24 selected African countries. Specifically, it investigates the moderating role of governance quality in the link between income inequality and economic complexity. The study applied the systems GMM panel estimation method to data spanning from 2000 to 2018, sourced from the World Bank, Harvard Dataverse, and Baker Library databases. The findings indicate that economic complexity significantly worsens income distribution in the study area. However, when the composite governance indicator is used as a moderator, the coefficient of the interaction term becomes negative and significant, implying that governance factors play a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of economic complexity on income inequality. Similar results were arrived in the disaggregated analysis of governance quality indicators, where each governance factor offsets the negative impact of complexity on income inequality. The findings suggest policy measures aimed at enhancing the quality of governance system to counteract the deteriorating effects of economic complexity on income inequality.																			2331-1886					DEC 31	2024	10	1							2341114	10.1080/23311886.2024.2341114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2024.2341114													WOS:001205223100001

This problem can be cast as an estimation task in a mixture model: at each marker the latent variable is the relatedness state, and the observed variable is the genotype of the two individuals. In this model, only the prior proportions are unknown, and can be obtained via ML estimation using the EM algorithm. When the markers are biallelic and the data unphased, the identifiability of the model is known not to be guaranteed. In this article, model identifiability is investigated in the case of phased data generated from a crossing design, a classical situation in plant genetics. It is shown that identifiability can be guaranteed under some conditions on the crossing design. The adapted ML estimator is implemented in an R package called Relatedness. The performance of the ML estimator is evaluated and compared to that of the benchmark moment estimator, both on simulated and real data. Compared to its competitor, the ML estimator is shown to be more robust and to provide more realistic estimates.

The methods of semantic relatedness measurement are very susceptible to inconsistencies of the ontology structure. The reason is that they do not use the whole structure of the domain to compare concepts. On the other hand, semantic relationship has wide span; it can contain similarity, opposition, inclusion, etc. In semantic relatedness measurement it is very important to take into account most available semantic relationship between concepts. In this paper a model for representing the position of concepts based on all defined relationships and other concepts in the domain has been proposed. Through this model concepts can be compared by taking into account all their implicit and explicit relationships with the other concepts of the domain. We represent each concept by a vector consisting of paths from the concept to the other concepts of the domain. The experimental results, using WordNet, show that not only our approach operates as well as other methods; it also resolves most inconsistencies in the other path-based ones.																					978-1-891706-26-4				2010							79	83																WOS:000391891600018

Here, an entity extraction system will be introduced to compute semantic relatedness. The previous works in this field convert a text to a set of words by different methods, and then compute semantic relatedness between these words of texts. In this paper a different approach will be proposed in which any text converts to a set of semantic entities to compute semantic relatedness. For this aim, it will be shown that using YAGO ontology, as one of the best background knowledge resources, can extract these entities from texts. To do this, a new algorithm for entity disambiguation will be suggested. Comparing the results with the literatures shows that the results of this new approach can be sufficiently reliable.																					978-0-7918-5993-3				2011							225	228																WOS:000310762400053

We study the suitability of Wikipedia as an alternative resource for ontologies regarding the Semantic Relatedness problem. We focus on the biomedical domain because (1) high quality manually curated ontologies are available and (2) successful graph based methods have been proposed for semantic relatedness in this domain. Because Wikipedia is not hierarchical and links do not convey defined semantic relationships, the same methods used on lexical resources (such as WordNet) cannot be applied here straightforwardly. Our contributions are (1) Demonstrating that Wikipedia based methods outperform state of the art ontology based methods on most of the existing ontologies in the biomedical domain (2) Adapting and evaluating the effectiveness of a group of bibliometric methods of various degrees of sophistication on Wikipedia for the first time (3) Proposing a new graph-based method that is outperforming existing methods by considering some specific features of Wikipedia structure.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-06483-3; 978-3-319-06482-6				2014	8436						381	386																WOS:000342631000042

On the one hand, humans easily make judgements about semantic relatedness. On the other hand, this kind of information is useful in language processing systems. While semantic relatedness has been extensively studied for English using numerous language resources, such as associative norms, human judgements and datasets generated from lexical databases, no evaluation resources of this kind have been available for Russian to date. Our contribution addresses this problem. We present five language resources of different scale and purpose for Russian semantic relatedness, each being a list of triples (wordi, wordj, similarityij). Four of them are designed for evaluation of systems for computing semantic relatedness, complementing each other in terms of the semantic relation type they represent. These benchmarks were used to organise a shared task on Russian semantic relatedness, which attracted 19 teams. We use one of the best approaches identified in this competition to generate the fifth high-coverage resource, the first open distributional thesaurus of Russian. Multiple evaluations of this thesaurus, including a large-scale crowdsourcing study involving native speakers, indicate its high accuracy.

The purpose of the present paper is to extend the regional branching framework by investigating how a regional knowledge base of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and others (non-ICTs) influences the specialization of financial technology (FinTech) in China at the city level. Accordingly, the empirical analysis focuses on the relationship between relatedness and FinTech diversification using panel data spanning the period 2008-2021 covering 247 China's cities. We obtain that the role of ICTs relatedness is positively relevant in explaining the emergence and development of new FinTech domains. However, non-ICT relatedness is a negative factor in the process of FinTech diversification, which we attribute to the fact that FinTech is less reliant on other knowledge base except ICT sectors. Additionally, the effects of ICTs relatedness are higher in peripheral cities compared to core cities in promoting FinTech diversification.

Evaluating the principle of relatedness: Estimation, drivers and implications for policy	RESEARCH POLICY												A growing body of research documents that the size and growth of an industry in a location depends on how much related activity is found there. This fact is commonly referred to as the "principle of relatedness". However, there is no consensus on why we observe the principle of relatedness, how to best operationalize it empirically or how this empirical regularity can help inform local industrial policy. We try to make progress by performing a structured search over tens of thousands of specifications to identify robust procedures to determine how well industries fit the local economies of US cities that perform well in terms of outof -sample predictions. To do so, we use data that allow us to derive relatedness from observing which industries co-occur in the portfolios of establishments, firms, cities and countries. Portfolios of these different productive entities yield different relatedness matrices, each of which helps predict the size and growth of local industries. However, our specification search not only identifies ways to improve the performance of such predictions, but also reveals new facts about the principle of relatedness and important trade-offs between predictive performance and interpretability. We use these insights to deepen our theoretical understanding of what underlies path -dependent development in cities and expand existing policy frameworks that leverage information from inter -industry relatedness analysis.

Kamrul; Miraz, Mahadi Hasan; Karim, Rashed Al			Motivating language and employees' need satisfaction to service quality: conservation of resources and speech act theories	MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW												PurposeDrawing on conservation of resources (CoR) and speech act theories, the authors tested the relationship between managers' motivating language (ML) and employee service quality and psychological relatedness and competence as mediating variables between their associations. Design/methodology/approachUsing a convenient sampling technique, the authors collected 366 hotel employees' opinions in Malaysia and analysed them in partial least squares-structural equation modelling. FindingsThree forms of ML, psychological competence and relatedness correlate with employees' service quality. Although direction-giving language is correlated with competence, empathetic and meaning-making language are not; thus, competence only mediates the relationship between direction-giving language and service quality. Three types (direction-giving, empathetic and meaning-making) of managers' communication are correlated with relatedness; thus, relatedness mediates the association between the three types of language and service quality. Practical implicationsHospitality managers are encouraged to enhance psychological relatedness and competence by practising an appropriate ML. Psychological relatedness and competence are significant mechanisms that enlighten the effects of supervisory communicant on service quality, indicating employees' need satisfaction should be improved. Originality/valueOur study contributes to speech act and CoR theories by explaining the relationship between ML, psychological relatedness, competence and service quality.

It has also been found that in the case of text fragments whose domain is already known, such as those extracted from research papers or complete documents pertaining to specific domains, it is more beneficial to use a knowledge-base corresponding to that domain instead of Wikipedia. We propose a method for calculating the semantic relatedness of text related to diseases, conditions, and wellness issues that uses ESA with MedlinePlus as its knowledge-base, and provides an improvement in the computation of semantic relatedness scores over the current state-of-the-art for the biomedical domain.																					978-1-4799-4236-7				2014							929	934																WOS:000357875700169

We develop a theoretical model that uses a real-option framework combined with optimal mechanism design to analyze how choices of boundaries and relatedness affect firm performance in the face of tradeoffs between governance and flexibility. We find that: (1) optimal boundaries and relatedness are substitutes in determining firm performance; (2) the association between relatedness, the most commonly studied aspect of diversification, and firm performance is indeterminate; (3) the substitution between relatedness and boundaries declines as noise in internal communication increases; (4) variation in relatedness has greater impact than boundary size when headquarters can pick multiple winners; and (5) as the internal market for information becomes more efficient, the lower the value of relatedness in combination with small boundaries. The general conceptual implication of these points is that corporate governance interacts with firm relatedness and boundaries in generating diversification performance.

The link between employment and MNE presence in the same and related industries is tested for European regions. The results suggest that cross-sectoral MNE spillovers are mediated through industrial relatedness and that they are positively and significantly associated with higher employment levels, independently of input-output relations. Our results indicate that regions characterised by lower factor prices are likely to benefit the most from the presence of multinationals in terms of employment, but these benefits are concentrated in high knowledge-intensive sectors, potentially fostering inequalities within less-developed economies.

Conventional methods mainly utilize the latent semantic information hidden in lexical databases (WordNet) or text corpus (Wikipedia). They have made great achievements based on the distance computation in lexical tree or co-occurrence principle in Wikipedia. However these methods suffer from low coverage and low precision because (1) lexical database contains abundant lexical information but lacks semantic information; (2) in Wikipedia, two related words (e.g. synonyms) may not appear in a window size or a sentence, and unrelated ones may be mentioned together by chance. To compute semantic relatedness more accurately, some other approaches have made great efforts based on free association network and achieved a significant improvement on relatedness measurement. Nevertheless, they need complex preprocessing in Wikipedia. Besides, the fixed score functions they adopt cause the lack of flexibility and expressiveness of model. In this paper, we leverage DBPedia and Wikipedia to construct a Knowledge Association Network (KAN) which avoids the information extraction of Wikipedia. We propose a flexible and expressive model to represent entities behind the words, in which attribute and topological structure information of entities are embedded in vector space simultaneously. The experiment results based on standard datasets show the better effectiveness of our model compared to previous models.					gu, binbin/KFQ-9951-2024	Gu, Binbinbin/0000-0002-4452-0038													0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-030-18576-3; 978-3-030-18575-6				2019	11446						676	691		10.1007/978-3-030-18576-3_40	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-18576-3_40													WOS:000485174600040

The Need for Relatedness at College Questionnaire (NRC-Q) was developed and tested to provide an instrument for identifying and understanding the various ways in which needs for relatedness, a salient motivator for many CSC, affect college success. On the basis of the recommendation from D. Guiffrida's (2006) cultural critique of V. Tinto's (1993) theory, the scale was developed with a self-determination theory (E. L. Deci & M. R. Ryan, 1991) perspective. Results support the content validity, internal consistency, temporal stability, and construct validity of the scale items, and a confirmatory factor analysis supported the underlying structures of the scale. Results also suggest that college students' needs for relatedness at home are more complex than previous research has suggested.

The results show that related establishments that colocate together outperform their counterparts located elsewhere, although it is not clear whether these findings are due to the presence of externalities or alternative explanations. To explore this issue, several proxies for the Marshallian sources of relatedness are further developed to better reveal the underlying mechanisms that drive relatedness. The findings show that technological proximity helps to respectively reduce the costs of moving goods, people, and ideas, thus providing strong support for Marshallian theories of agglomeration. The ownership structure of the firm matters, however. Specifically, wholly privately owned enterprises are more successful than firms where the state is a minority shareholder at converting technologically related spillovers into higher profits and higher-efficiency gains.

The best run of TrWP was ranked 33 among 73 runs. f finds the relatedness strength between two phrases using overlapping bi-gram context extracted from the Google-n-gram corpus. The relatedness strength is the strength of association capturing how similar or dissimilar two phrases are. In order to find the relatedness strength, f applies a sum-ratio (SR) technique based on the statistics of the overlapping n-grams associated with two input phrases. The experimental result from f demonstrates improvement over existing phrase relatedness methods on two standard datasets of 216 phrase-pairs. f does not require any human annotated resource and is independent of the syntactic structure of phrases.

ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER												The COVID-19 pandemic has moved university teaching and learning activities that conventionally take place in physical classrooms to online platforms. There is an urgent need to investigate university students' experience and perceptions of online learning during the pandemic so as to optimize online learning strategies in tertiary education during and after the pandemic. Based on self-determination theory and the social cognitive perspective, the present study investigated the relationship between perceived relatedness with instructors and classmates, online self-regulated learning (OSRL), perceived learning gains, and satisfaction of 572 Chinese undergraduate students. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrapping, we found: (1) relatedness was positively associated with OSRL; (2) relatedness had no direct effect on either perceived learning gains or satisfaction; (3) OSRL has a full mediating effect on the relationship between relatedness and perceived learning gains; (4) there was a serial mediating effect of OSRL and perceived learning gains on the relationship between relatedness and satisfaction; and (5) task strategies and goal setting contributed most to OSRL's mediating effects. Our work provides university instructors, online course designers, and online platform providers with new insights into the importance of supporting undergraduate students' OSRL (particularly task strategies and goal setting) via developing social connections for improving their perceived learning gains and satisfaction in online learning environments.

By using the knowledge bases and current methods, the semantic relatedness measure could be done. This time, we implement the hybrid method in measuring semantic relatedness between the pair of word. Hybrid method is one of the most popular method that used to measures semantic relatedness. Hybrid method combine several methods in order to optimize correlation coefficient. We will combine two method that are often used. These method are path-based and gloss-based method. Path-based methods is a method based on taxonomy that were defined in knowledge bases. While the measurement of gloss-based methods are based on description and the conceptual meaning of the word. Knowledge bases that were used is WordNet and the selection of hybrid method is intended to prove whether there is an increase in correlation by combining those methods. Based on test scenario that were conducted, hybrid method gives higher correlation compared with the one that only used one method. The correlation result between words in hybrid method is 0.337.

RRI activity in the science classroom discloses the positive and negative impact of research and innovation discoveries for the society. The evaluation of the negative and positive sides of the research and innovation involves school students in discussion and gives a possibility to feel competent and related with others. 5E model is used in this research. It encompasses formal and infOrmal science education. The purpose of the study is to explore the influence of perceived competence and relatedness on school students' intrinsic motivation for learning science in RRI activity. The data presented in the current study are a part of the 7BP ENGAGE project, implemented in Lithuania (2014-2017). The participants chosen for this study were 8th-10th grade school students from different schools of Lithuania. Multiple regression analysis was used to test if the two basic psychological needs (perceived competence and relatedness) significantly predicted students' intrinsic motivation for learning science. Our research revealed that school students' motivation for learning science was simultaneously influenced by perceived competence and relatedness in RRI activity. We established a statistically significant relation between the students' motivation for learning science and their perceived competence and relatedness. Perceived competence influenced the school students' motivation for learning science more than perceived relatedness in RRI.

In this sense, it is stated that the role of a country in the production and export of sophisticated goods is one of the determinant factors to increase the level of income. In the literature, the concept of economic complexity, which is expressed as gaining competitiveness of complex products in terms of production and export, is noteworthy in recent years. In this framework, relationship between the per capita GDP and the economic complexity is examined with regression analysis in this study for selected countries with high-level of income. In the analysis, in which random coefficient panel regression model is applied, a significant relationship was found between the two variables for Austria, Finland, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Singapore and Sweden.

J	Fitjar, RD; Timmermans, B				Fitjar, Rune Dahl; Timmermans, Bram			Regional skill relatedness: towards a new measure of regional related diversification	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES												This paper proposes a novel index of regional skill-relatedness and calculates this measure for all Norwegian labour-market regions. Studies of regional related diversification rely on measures of related variety, which build on the industry classification hierarchy. However, the growing literature identifying similarities in knowledge and competences across industries demonstrates that these classifications fail to identify a great deal of actual skill relatedness, and that measures based on empirical measures of industry relatedness are required. The skill relatedness measure builds on labour mobility flows across industries to develop a relatedness matrix for Norwegian industries. It further uses social network analysis to identify the number of other regional industries to which each industry in a particular region is related. Comparing this measure to the related variety index, the analysis shows that the two measures are highly correlated, but that the regional skill relatedness index is able to identify more of the relatedness across industries. In particular, the related variety index tends to underestimate the level of relatedness in many of Norway's most technologically sophisticated manufacturing regions, whereas these rank highly in the regional skill relatedness index. Consequently, the regional skill relatedness index represents a promising new tool for identifying relatedness in regional systems.

REGIONAL STUDIES												Smart Specialisation was conceived as a 'bottom-up' framework to identify new growth paths connected to knowledge cores within regions. Although operationalization of Smart Specialisation has proven difficult, recent mappings of technologies in terms of technological relatedness and complexity suggest a useful cost-benefit framework. We extend these ideas, locating European Union cities in a Smart Specialisation space and tracking their development of technology since 1980. Results indicate that European Union cities with the largest gains in complex and related technologies enjoy an economic performance premium over cities with smaller gains in the complexity and relatedness of their knowledge bases.

Initial Teacher Education (ITE) has been seen as one of the ways to increase teachers' confidence, yet such provision is variable and has not been studied extensively. In this study, we explore how a practical outdoor session can increase motivation to teach outdoors. Moreover, using a Self-Determination Theory framework we hypothesise that increased nature relatedness would be associated with higher perceived competence and willingness to teach outdoors. Forty-nine ITE students took part in the outdoor session, and responded to pre- and post-measures of nature relatedness, perceived competence and willingness to teach outdoors. Results suggest a positive correlation between nature relatedness and both perceived competence and willingness to undertake outdoor sessions. Moreover, nature relatedness was significantly higher after the outdoor environmental education session.

This paper reports findings from an Australian study with 257 teachers, that explored their mastery, work-avoidance, and relational goal orientations and four dimensions of self-reported classroom behaviours: expectation, structure, autonomy support, and relatedness. Structural equation modelling underscored the importance of mastery and relational goal orientations as adaptive goal orientations that positively predicted teachers' perceptions about their expectation, structure, and relatedness with students. Interestingly neither of these adaptive goal orientations predicted teachers' self-reported behavior of autonomy support. The only significant predictor was work-avoidance goal orientations, which negatively predicted teachers' discemments of supporting student autonomy.

Industry relatedness and employment growth in Italy	INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION												The role of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) in fostering innovation and growth in the wider economy has been much debated, beginning with Bakhshi et al. (2008) seminal contribution. Such studies of creative industries assign a strategic role to territories, but they provide little empirical evidence. In this paper, the issues of the creative economy are combined with evolutionary economic geography topics to understand whether the CCIs are able to foster innovation and growth in the wider economy. Using an indicator of the relatedness between creative and other sectors for the Italian provinces, we analyse employment growth over a period of ten years (2006-2015). A panel data analysis is then applied to investigate the role of relatedness and the clustering of creative industries in wider economic growth, showing that, to favour growth, the creative industries require the presence of other sectors with a high degree of proximity/relatedness.

In this study, it is instead argued that the spread of green products through economic complexity and international trade are possible means of solving this problem. To this end, the individual and interactive environmental impacts of economic complexity and international green trade are examined in a panel of 24 European Union nations between 2000 and 2018. Panel quantile regressions (QRs) and Driscoll-Kraay fixed effect-OLS regressions are employed in analysing the relationships. The findings reveal that both green trade and economic complexity have beneficial individual effects on the environment. Their interaction effect further confirms that they have a complementary synergistic impact on the environment of the 24 EU countries. It thus implies that both green trade and economic complexity act better together than separately. Countries interested in achieving sustainable environment can do so by raising local productive capabilities, such that they are able to quickly transition into the production of technology-intensive, eco-friendly items. Alternatively, they can also explore the unique benefits provided by international trade in green products in cases where they do not have the ability to locally produce certain green goods. Better still, they can pursue both objectives simultaneously.

This paper, concerned with these automated methods, attempts to improve Gloss Vector semantic relatedness measure for more reliable estimation of relatedness between two input concepts. Generally, this measure by considering frequency cut-off for bigrams tries to remove low and high frequency words which usually do not end up being significant features. However, this naive cutting approach can lead to loss of valuable information. By employing pointwise mutual information (PMI) as a measure of association between features, we will try to enforce the foregoing elimination step in a statistical fashion. Applying both approaches to the biomedical domain, using MEDLINE as corpus, MeSH as thesaurus, and available reference standard of 311 concept pairs manually rated for semantic relatedness, we will show that PMI for removing insignificant features is more effective approach than frequency cut-off.

An exploratory study on Vietnamese university students	JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH												Objective This study aims to examine the relationship between nature relatedness (NR) on subjective positive well-being (life satisfaction) and mental disorders (depression, stress, and anxiety) in Vietnamese university students. Participants 340 Hue University students voluntarily took part in the survey. Methods The Nature Relatedness Scale, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. Bivariate correlation, single regression, and moderation analysis were conducted to investigate the relationship between NR and the mental health of university students and the moderating role of NR. Results Higher levels of NR significantly predicted higher levels of life satisfaction but did not significantly predict fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. NR significantly moderated the link between life satisfaction and depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusions The findings of this study imply that efforts to enhance students' mental health should include efforts to promote their NR.

There may, however, be benefits to recognising the potential inter-relatedness of events in a destination and developing synergies between them. This study analyses a calendar of events based in Madeira, Portugal, to identify areas of relatedness that could be cross-leveraged by managing and marketing the events as a strategic portfolio. Accordingly, a questionnaire was administered among attendees at five major events, yielding 3118 responses. These data were analysed using ANOVA and two types of regression. The results suggest that, firstly, it is prudent to employ a range of analytical techniques to the available data to identify appropriate strategic levers. Secondly, the findings demonstrate the potential for post-hoc analysis not only to identify areas of relatedness between the events but also to discover gaps that can be filled by new events. Thirdly, the findings emphasise the pivotal role that destination marketing organisations can play in facilitating the design and implementation of event portfolio strategies based on the cross-leveraging of areas of relatedness between the events.

The proposed method starts from the neighborhood graph of a concept as the primary form and transfers this graph into a vector space to obtain the final representation. The proposed method achieves state of the art results on various relatedness datasets. Combining the vector space representation with standard coherence model, we show that the proposed relatedness method performs successfully in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We then suggest a different formulation for coherence to demonstrate that, in a short enough sentence, there is one key entity that can help disambiguate every other entity. Using this finding, we provide a vector space based method that can outperform the standard coherence model in a significantly shorter computation time.

Most related studies do not take advantage of the semantics carried by Wikipedia categories. We develop a SR computing framework exploiting Wikipedia category structure to generate abstract features for texts and considering the lexical overlap between a pair of text. Experiments on three datasets show that our framework could gain better performance against ESA and most other methods. It indicates that Wikipedia category graph is a promising resource to aid natural language text analysis.

Environmentally active people: the role of autonomy, relatedness, competence and self-determined motivation	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH												To identify pathways to lower environmental impacts, this research examined the motivation and antecedents of motivation (autonomy, relatedness, competence), of environmentally active people. Previous research suggests that people with more self-determined motivation for pro-environmental behavior (PEB) should carry out more PEBs, and have lower environmental impacts, than people whose motivation is more externally regulated. Path analysis in Sample 1 (N=261) confirmed that self-determined motivation was positively related to both easy and difficult PEB. The more participants judged that their needs for autonomy and relatedness were met in relation to performing PEB, the more self-determined their motivation. Higher perceived relatedness was also directly related to reporting more engagement in difficult PEB. Perceived competence was not related to self-determined motivation or PEB. The pattern of results was largely supported when re-tested with a sample (N=320) who completed a carbon footprint' measure of environmental impact as well as the questionnaire completed by Sample 1. In this sample, autonomy, relatedness, and competence were related to self-determined motivation. The research is the first to our knowledge to examine and find a relationship between higher self-determined motivation and lower self-reported environmental impact. These findings point to new approaches to increasing PEB.

The vector elements are weighted by the combination of TF-IDF scheme and the link status of Concept Interpreting Network in which nodes represent the concepts and edges represent the interpreting relation between concepts. Assessing the relatedness amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics. Compared with the previous state of the art, using RFA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments: from r = 0.75 to 0.78 for concepts and performs better in recalling the top n relevant concepts than ESA method. Importantly, the RFA model could evaluate semantic similarity for concepts with low occurrence in Wikipeida articles and eliminate the negative effect caused by the meaningless occurrence of words in the Wikipedia articles, which the approach of ESA neglects.																					978-0-7918-5990-2				2011							467	472																WOS:000306295700099

During the subject, the PSCD teacher aims to enhance social and emotional competences, whilst encouraging positive and healthy relationships. The Self-Determination Theory provides the basis for this approach, namely to focus on students' need to feel competent, autonomous and related. In this study, we wanted to investigate how the use of the circle configuration adopted in PSCD, combined with the Experiential Learning Cycle and Processing helped to enhance the three psychological needs outlined in the Self Determination Theory. Two online focus groups were carried out with graduate PSCD teachers, teaching in the primary and the secondary sectors, to assess whether the circle pedagogy used during PSCD lessons increased students' relatedness in the class, autonomy and competence, thereby furthering their psychosocial well-being. The study showed that the students' autonomy and competence was influenced by their sense of relatedness in the class. The research also showed that when addressing the 3 SDT psychological needs, students are more willing to engage and contribute during the lessons. This puts greater responsibility on the PSCD teachers because they need to be trained in facilitative skills, make good use of the confidentiality clause and know when to refer, if the need arises.						camilleri, stephen/0000-0002-5194-9959													0264-3944	1468-0122				OCT 2	2023	41	4					449	472		10.1080/02643944.2022.2148173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02643944.2022.2148173		DEC 2022											WOS:000894926600001

Conventional relatedness' concerns local portfolios, which is insufficient to capture the global-local interactive nature of export specialisation. We propose a framework consisting of relatedness embedded in commodity structures and trade networks. It considers interactions between domestic supply and overseas demand, and between internal market competition and external market expansion. The empirical study based on 334 prefectures in China during 2001-2013 supports the theoretical prediction. The findings suggest that the development policy for export-oriented regions should consider both capacity building internally and network construction externally.																			1752-1378	1752-1386				MAR	2019	12	1			SI		105	126		10.1093/cjres/rsy031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsy031													WOS:000462572500006

J	Neffke, FMH; Otto, A; Weyh, A				Neffke, Frank M. H.; Otto, Anne; Weyh, Antje			Inter-industry labor flows	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION												Using German social security data, we study inter-industry labor mobility to assess how industry-specific human capital is and to determine which industries have similar human capital requirements. We find that inter-industry labor flows are highly concentrated in just a handful of industry pairs. Consequently, labor flows connect industries in a sparse network. We interpret this network as an expression of industries similarities in human capital requirements, or skill relatedness. This skill-relatedness network is stable overtime, similar for different types of workers and independent of whether workers switch jobs locally or over larger distances. Moreover, in an application to regional diversification and local industry growth, skill relatedness proves to be more predictive than colocation or value chain relations. To facilitate future research, we make detailed inter-industry relatedness matrices online available. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, ZG; Yang, YP				Chen, Zugang; Yang, Yaping			Semantic relatedness algorithm for keyword sets of geographic metadata	CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE												Advances in linked geospatial data, recommender systems, and geographic information retrieval have led to urgent necessity to assess the overall semantic relatedness between keyword sets of geographic metadata. In this study, a new model is proposed for computing the semantic relatedness between arbitrary two keyword sets of geographic metadata stored in current global spatial data infrastructures. In this model, the overall semantic relatedness is derived by pairing these keywords that are found to be most relevant to each other and averaging their relatedness. To find the most relevant keywords across two keyword sets precisely, the keywords in the keyword set of geographic metadata are divided into three kinds: the thesaurus elements, the WordNet elements, and the statistical elements. The thesaurus-lexical relatedness measure (TLRM), the extended thesaurus-lexical relatedness measure (ETLRM), and the Longest Common Substring method are proposed to compute the semantic relatedness between two thesaurus elements, two WordNet elements, a thesaurus element, and a WordNet element and two statistical elements, respectively. A human data set - the geographic-metadata's keyword set relatedness dataset, which was used to evaluate the precision of the semantic relatedness measures of keyword sets of geographic metadata, was created. The proposed method was evaluated against the human-generated relatedness judgments and was compared with the Jaccard method and Vector Space Model. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a high correlation with human judgments and outperformed the existing methods. Finally, the proposed method was applied to quantitatively linked geospatial data.						chen, Zugang/0000-0002-7782-9488													1523-0406	1545-0465				MAR 3	2020	47	2					125	140		10.1080/15230406.2019.1647797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2019.1647797		SEP 2019											WOS:000487016300001

We conducted a quasi-experimental field study with university students (N=160), who were evenly distributed between an experimental (EG) and a control group (CG). The results of multi-group path analysis suggest that simultaneously fostering autonomy, competence, and relatedness (EG), in comparison to providing autonomy and competence support only (CG), leads to a stronger link between perceived competence and social relatedness. If students experience moderation competence, they in turn feel socially related to their teacher, which leads to an even higher competence perception thereafter. The crucial role of teachers' behaviour, in particular relatedness support, in learning development is discussed.

J	Guo, Q; He, CF				Guo, Qi; He, Canfei			Production space and regional industrial evolution in China	GEOJOURNAL												A growing literature on evolutionary economic geography concludes that regional industrial evolution is path-dependent and is determined by the preexisting industries. This study more accurately calculates the industry relatedness based on the cooccurrence approach to portray the production space of China's manufacturing sectors and then examines the impact of industry relatedness on regional industrial evolution. The findings report that industry relatedness does underscore the regional structural change in China but shows significant regional differences in the evolution path. The coastal region has strong tendency of path dependence in its industrial evolution, while North West and South West break the path-dependent trajectory and transition into high productive sectors distant from their own production network. The results suggest that governmental policies can play a crucial role in creating new paths in the West. Institutions matter to allow the significant role of industry relatedness in driving regional industrial evolution.

J	Adebayo, TS				Adebayo, Tomiwa Sunday			Environmental consequences of fossil fuel in Spain amidst renewable energy consumption: a new insights from the wavelet-based Granger causality approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												By comparing ecological footprint and biocapacity, the load capacity factor follows a given ecological threshold, thus allowing for a thorough study of environmental deterioration. As a result, this research uses the load capacity factor (LCF) as a distinct proxy for ecological deterioration, resulting in a detailed environmental evaluation tool that considers both ecological footprint and biocapacity at the same time. Based on this knowledge, the current research investigates the relationship between load capacity factor (LCF) and fossil fuel (FF), renewable energy (REC), economic complexity (ECI) and foreign direct investment (FDI) in Spain utilizing a dataset covering the period between 1970Q1 and 2017Q4. We applied the novel wavelet coherence technique to assess the connection and/or causality interrelationship between LCF and the exogenous variables at various frequencies and different timeframes. The outcomes of the wavelet correlation disclosed that: (i) In the short and medium term, REC enhances the quality of the environment; (ii) In the short and medium term, fossil fuels worsen the quality of the environment; (iii) At all frequencies, FDI inflows enhance the quality of the environment; and (iv) In the short, medium and long term, economic complexity hinders the quality of the environment. In addition, the MWC and PWC outcomes are consistent with the wavelet coherence outcomes. Moreover, the wavelet-based Granger causality revealed that all the variables can predict each other at various frequencies.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AS MODES OF MARKET ENTRY	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												An established firm can enter a new product market through acquisition or internal development. Predictions that the choice of market entry mode depends on 'relatedness' between the new product and the firm's existing products have repeatedly failed to gain empirical support. We resolve ambiguity in prior work by developing dynamic measures of relatedness, and by making a distinction between entries inside vs. outside a firm's primary business domain. Using a fine-grained dataset on the telecommunications sector, we find that inside a firm's primary business domain, acquisitions are used to fill persistent gaps near the firm's existing products, whereas outside that domain, acquisitions are used to extend the enterprise in new directions.

JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												Following the impact on regional renewal and employment ascribed to rapidly growing firms (High impact firms, HIFs) this article argues that little is still known in economic geography and business studies today regarding the mechanisms influencing growth of such firms and, hence, the potential impact on regional employment. The aim of this article is thus to explore how the qualitative content of skills (i.e. the degree of similarity, relatedness and un-relatedness) recruited to a firm during a period of fast growth, which influences its future success. Our findings, based on a sample of 1589 HIFs in the Swedish economy, suggest that it is not only the number of people employed that matters to aid understanding of the future destiny of the firms-but also, more importantly, it is the scope of the skills recruited and their proximity to related industries.

J	Domini, G				Domini, Giacomo			Patterns of specialization and economic complexity through the lens of universal exhibitions, 1855-1900	EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY												The complexity of a country's product mix is related to its economic growth. This paper extends this key insight from the economic growth literature to the second half of the 19th century, by reconstructing Revealed Comparative Advantages (RCA) and Economic Complexity Indices (ECI) for tens of polities, including both independent countries and colonies. It does so by exploiting product-polity information from the catalogues of five universal exhibitions, held in Paris in the second half of the 19th century (1855, 1867, 1878, 1889, 1900). For this period, exhibition data are available at a more disaggregated level than export data, on which RCA and ECI are typically based. This is the first application of ECI to the pre-Second World War era. A significant relation is observed between ECI, the level of GDP per capita, and the latter's long-run growth. Furthermore, the evolution of RCA and ECI reveals processes of structural change and economic development, notably the emergence of Germany and Switzerland, which developed along the technological paradigms of the second industrial revolution and thus attained positions of technological and economic primacy.																			0014-4983	1090-2457				JAN	2022	83								101421	10.1016/j.eeh.2021.101421	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2021.101421		JAN 2022											WOS:000745802000005

REGIONAL STUDIES												We analyse whether regionally embedded or firm-level capabilities drive regional diversification in industrial districts, examining the relationship between relatedness and Marshallian agglomerations. We argue that regional diversification lacks an explicit mechanism to explain branching into new products, positing that the origin of regional product branching is based on firm-level heterogeneity of capabilities and diversification, which is overlooked. Using mixed methods and patent analysis (1895-2019; 3592 patents and utility models), product diversification in the Toy Valley district in Alicante (Spain) is analysed, showing that firm-level related diversification with extensive local search explains the mechanism of the regional relatedness diversification.

J	de Andrés, P; de la Fuente, G; Velasco, P				de Andres, Pablo; de la Fuente, Gabriel; Velasco, Pilar			Diversification, relatedness and growth options value: Beyond a linear relationship	LONG RANGE PLANNING												This paper investigates how corporate diversification affects a firm's growth options value. We adopt a real options approach from which diversification is seen as both a way to exploit current growth options (option exercise effect) and as a source of future options to expand (option creation effect). We focus on two dimensions of this strategy: degree of diversification and relatedness between segments. Using a panel sample of U.S. firms from 1998 to 2014, and accounting for the endogenous nature of the diversification decision, we find a U-form relationship between diversification degree and growth options value, suggesting that this strategy may primarily become a source of growth options after a certain point. Relatedness has an inverse U-relation with growth options value, suggesting that positive effects from synergies are limited to a certain level after which negative effects from duplicities prevail. Results also reveal that such an inverse U-linkage of relatedness is less pronounced in high diversifiers than in low ones. This study extends the applicability of the real options approach to strategy, and suggests the relevance of a multidimensional and contingent view in the diversification debate.

J	Lien, LB; Klein, PG				Lien, Lasse B.; Klein, Peter G.			Can the Survivor Principle Survive Diversification?	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE												The survivor principle holds that the competitive process weeds out inefficient firms, so that hypotheses about efficient behavior can be tested by observing what firms actually do. This principle underlies a large body of empirical work in strategy, economics, and management. But do competitive markets really select for efficient behavior? Is the survivor principle reliable? We evaluate the survivor principle in the context of corporate diversification, asking if survivor-based measures of interindustry relatedness are good predictors of firms' decisions to exit particular lines of business, controlling for other firm and industry characteristics that affect firms' portfolio choices. We find strong, robust evidence that survivor-based relatedness is an important determinant of exit. This empirical regularity is consistent with an efficiency rationale for firm-level diversification, though we cannot rule out alternative explanations based on firms' desire for legitimacy by imitation and attempts to temper multimarket competition.

Using independent methodologies, we distinguish between the scientific knowledge set and the technical knowledge set, and separate these from other kinds of prior expertise. We find that the patents of the inventors who have a prior scholarly knowledge of the topic are on average more important (more cited after 6 years). Conversely, we find an inverted U-shape relationship between prior technical relatedness and patent importance. These results are potentially useful to support the work of practitioners such as university technology managers, which often face difficulties in identifying the importance and perspective value of the disclosed inventions, amid high market and legal uncertainty and budget shortages.

J	Howell, A				Howell, Anthony			Industry relatedness, FDI liberalization and the indigenous innovation process in China	REGIONAL STUDIES												This paper employs a structural innovation model to study the process of indigenous innovation in China and the role of industry relatedness. To better take into account China's transitioning economy context, it further tests to what extent the relationship between relatedness and firms' innovation process is influenced by the relaxation of foreign ownership controls, an arguably exogenous shock. Controlling for selection, simultaneity and unobserved heterogeneity, the results show that firm research and development (R&D) boosts innovation output, which in turn enhances firm productivity. Relatedness economies are positively related to each phase of innovation, although the size of the effects depends on the type of firm and the stage of innovation. Foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalization encourages firms to rely more on relatedness economies: (1) to complement R&D spending that is required to adapt foreign technologies to local applications; (2) to recombine knowledge from related industries in order to bring forth new proprietary ideas, processes or concepts; and (3) to help solve process or organizational problems faced in related industries.

J	Mëuller, VP; Eichhammer, W				Mueller, Viktor Paul; Eichhammer, Wolfgang			Economic complexity of green hydrogen production technologies-a trade data-based analysis of country-specific industrial preconditions	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Countries with high energy demand but limited renewable energy potential are planning to meet part of their future energy needs by importing green hydrogen. For potential exporting countries, in addition to sufficient renewable resources, industrial preconditions are also relevant for the successful implementation of green hydrogen production value chains. A list of 36 "Green H2 Products" needed for stand-alone hydrogen production plants was defined and their economic complexity was analyzed using international trade data from 1995 to 2019. These products were found to be comparatively complex to produce and represent an opportunity for countries to enter new areas of the product space through green diversification. Large differences were revealed between countries in terms of industrial preconditions and their evolution over time. A detailed analysis of nine MENA countries showed that Turkey and Tunisia already possess industrial know-how in various green hydrogen technology components and perform only slightly worse than potential European competitors, while Algeria, Libya, and Saudi Arabia score the lowest in terms of calculated hydrogen-related green complexity. These findings are supported by statistical tests showing that countries with a higher share of natural resources rents in their gross domestic product score significantly lower on economic and green complexity. The results thus provide new perspectives for assessing the capabilities of potential hydrogen-producing countries, which may prove useful for policymakers and investors. Simultaneously, this paper contributes to the theory of economic complexity by applying its methods to a new subset of products, and using a dataset with long-term coverage.																			1364-0321	1879-0690				AUG	2023	182								113304	10.1016/j.rser.2023.113304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.113304		MAY 2023											WOS:001055867900001
J	Schinckus, C				Schinckus, Christophe			Agent-based modelling and economic complexity: a diversified perspective	JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC STUDIES												Purpose The term "agent-based modelling" (ABM) is a buzzword which is widely used in the scientific literature even though it refers to a variety of methodologies implemented in different disciplinary contexts. The numerous works dealing with ABM require a clarification to better understand the lines of thinking paved by this approach in economics. All modelling tasks are a means and a source of knowledge, and this epistemic function can vary depending on the methodology. this paper is to present four major ways (deductive, abductive, metaphorical and phenomenological) of implementing an agent-based framework to describe economic systems. ABM generates numerous debates in economics and opens the room for epistemological questions about the micro-foundations of macroeconomics; before dealing with this issue, the purpose of this paper is to identify the kind of ABM the author can find in economics. Design/methodology/approach The profusion of works dealing with ABM requires a clarification to understand better the lines of thinking paved by this approach in economics. This paper offers a conceptual classification outlining the major trends of ABM in economics. Findings There are four categories of ABM in economics. Originality/value This paper suggests a methodological categorization of ABM works in economics.																				2515-964X				OCT 22	2019	26	2					170	188		10.1108/JABES-12-2018-0108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JABES-12-2018-0108													WOS:000730864900001

We argue that during institutional transitions, political ties and international experience represent different types of institutional relatedness linking firms, respectively, to political institutions and market institutions. Specifically, CEOs' political ties may help firms access critical resources, sense new market entry opportunities, and gain board support to increase firms' product diversification. CEOs' international experience may help firms leverage different market-based capabilities, engage in international competition, and then lead firms to grow on a different path by expanding internationally. We further investigate a crucial contingency factor: the degree of economic freedom. Data from 11,992 firm-year observations based on firms listed on China's stock exchanges between 2001 and 2011 largely support our predictions.

Job demands and resources, teachers' subjective vitality, and turnover intentions: an examination during COVID-19	EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the role of two job resources (relatedness with students, relatedness with colleagues), two job demands (time pressure and disruptive student behaviour), and their unique and moderated associations with subjective work vitality and, in turn, turnover intentions among teachers during COVID-19. Data were collected from 325 Australian teachers when many schools were closed or reopening after the initial COVID-19 lockdown. Structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that time pressure (negatively) and relatedness with teachers (positively) were associated with subjective vitality. Disruptive behaviour and time pressure (both positively), along with relatedness with students and subjective vitality (both negatively) were associated with turnover intentions. In addition to these main associations, there was one significant interaction providing evidence of the buffering role of relatedness with students on turnover intentions. The findings yield knowledge of job resources that may help support teachers during subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other future disruptions.																			0144-3410	1469-5820				MAY 28	2023	43	5			SI		452	471		10.1080/01443410.2022.2036323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2022.2036323		FEB 2022											WOS:000757695700001
J	Mukhametov, D				Mukhametov, Daniyar			Exploring the Influence of Government Data Performance on Knowledge Capabilities: Towards a Data-Oriented Political Economy	SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL												This article is devoted to the study of the influence of government data performance on knowledge capabilities. Knowledge capabilities play a key role in open innovation and creation of citizen-oriented products and services. However, it is necessary to assess the role of the information environment in the development of knowledge capabilities, including government data as a product and a component of the information environment. Government data performance is expressed through the statistical capacity score and its three dimensions: periodicity assessment of statistical capacity, methodology assessment of statistical capacity, and source data assessment of statistical capacity. Knowledge capabilities are expressed through economic complexity, which reflects the diversity and uniqueness of the production capabilities inherent in each country's exports. Econometric analysis is based on dynamic panel data models that quantify the effect of government data performance on economic complexity. The final dataset includes 94 countries and their indicators for the selected variables for 2004-2019. The models show that government data performance and its various dimensions influence economic complexity because government data provide a detailed and publicly available description of the economic space, including available resources and potential tasks. Based on these data, agents can produce dissimilar and unique products. This logic may be true in general for the influence of government data performance on knowledge capabilities: structured and complete government data reduces the cost of information analysis and provides information support for decisions. The results of the study contribute to the ideas of a data-oriented political economy. Government participation in value creation includes various forms of indirect influence. The provision of government data is one of these forms. The development of collective data governance and collaborative data projects makes it possible to create more complete datasets and stimulates citizen involvement and deliberation.

Teacher well-being and sense of relatedness with students: Examining associations over one school term	TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION												We examined teacher well-being (subjective vitality, behavioral engagement, and professional growth) at three timepoints across a school term, along with teachers' sense of relatedness with students. Univariate latent growth curve modeling demonstrated significant declines in the well-being factors across the school term. Bivariate latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that higher initial levels of relatedness with students predicted steeper declines in subjective vitality and professional growth-however, teachers with higher initial relatedness still ended the term with similar or higher levels of vitality/growth. Teachers who declined more steeply in relatedness also declined more steeply on each of the three well-being factors. & COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

State-of-the-art methods typically combine local scores accounting for the similarity between mentions and entities, with a global score measuring the coherence of the set of selected entities. The latter relies on the structure of a KB: the hyperlink graph of Wikipedia in most cases or the graph of an RDF KB, e.g., BaseKB or Yago, to benefit from the precise semantics of relationships between entities. In this paper, we devise a novel RDF-based entity relatedness measure for global scores with important properties: (i) it has a clear semantics, (ii) it can be calculated at reasonable computational cost, and (iii) it accounts for the transitive aspects of entity relatedness through existing (bounded length) property paths between entities in an RDF KB. Further, we experimentally show on the TAC-KBP2017 dataset, both with BaseKB and Yago, that it provides significant improvement over state-of-the-art entity relatedness measures for the collective entity linking task.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-030-62419-4; 978-3-030-62418-7				2020	12506						164	182		10.1007/978-3-030-62419-4_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-62419-4_10													WOS:000587238800010

Drawing on the network-based approach of evolutionary economic geography, we employ a detailed individual-level panel dataset to construct skill-relatedness networks for 72 functional labour market regions in Sweden. Subsequent fixed-effect panel regressions indicate that increasing density of skill-related high-income jobs within a region is conducive to low-wage workers moving to better-paid jobs, hence facilitating labour market upgrading through diversification. While metropolitan regions offer a premium for this relationship, it also holds for smaller regions, and across various worker characteristics.

RESOURCE RELATEDNESS, REDEPLOYABILITY, AND FIRM VALUE	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Our paper elaborates the effects of resource relatedness on value of a multibusiness firm. We emphasize that value results from interplay of benefits of synergy and redeployability. This view, considering how synergy and redeployability interact in determining value, extends prior separate considerations of the two benefits. We also diagnose that the value effect of resource relatedness is contingent on uncertainty and specify this contingent relationship. We use the real option valuation approach and formally evaluate the impacts of the two effects of relatedness. This explication enables us to demonstrate how redeployability contributes to value beyond synergy, and how they contribute in tandem. In this sense, we illuminate previously undiagnosed value in multibusiness firms. Beyond theoretical implications, our results have important empirical and managerial implications.

Relatedness Need Satisfaction, Intrinsic Motivation, and Engagement in Secondary School Physical Education	JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION												Purpose: Using self-determination theory, this study examined unique contributions of relatedness need satisfaction (to both teachers and peers) to intrinsic motivation and engagement (behavioral, cognitive, and emotional) over and above those of autonomy need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction among Turkish students in secondary school physical education. Methods: Participants were 331 (162 boys, 169 girls) middle and high school students enrolled in physical education classes at four public schools in the southwest Turkey. Data were collected by previously validated questionnaires. Results: No gender differences occurred in the mean levels of relatedness to teachers need satisfaction and relatedness to peers need satisfaction. These two types of relatedness need satisfaction made significant unique contributions to student engagement for both boys and girls. The differential roles of relatedness to peers need satisfaction in predicting boys' and girls' engagement were observed. Discussion/Conclusion: The study demonstrated that two types of relatedness need satisfaction uniquely predicted students' engagement in a secondary school physical education setting. This finding supports self-determination theory that relatedness need satisfaction is an important motivator for students in schools.

J	Santoalha, A; Consoli, D; Castellacci, F				Santoalha, Artur; Consoli, Davide; Castellacci, Fulvio			Digital skills, relatedness and green diversification: A study of European regions	RESEARCH POLICY												Prior research identifies relatedness as a key driver of new specializations in the domain of green technologies. The present paper extends the evolutionary economic geography framework by focussing on digital literacy. Specifically, we argue that workforce skills associated with the use and development of ICT technologies are an important, if understudied, determinant of regional diversification into new green technologies. Accordingly, we analyse their relationships with relatedness and green diversification using panel data on 142 European regions for the period 2006 - 2013. We find that e-skills endowment is a positive predictor of regions' ability to specialise in new technological domains, and especially for green specializations. Further, e-skills negatively moderate the effect of relatedness on technological diversification. These results call attention to the potential of digitalisation in the context of the transition towards a greener economy.

The Design of Early-Stage Plant Breeding Trials Using Genetic Relatedness	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS												The use of appropriate statistical methods has a key role in improving the accuracy of selection decisions in a plant breeding program. This is particularly important in the early stages of testing in which selections are based on data from a limited number of field trials that include large numbers of breeding lines with minimal replication. The method of analysis currently recommended for early-stage trials in Australia involves a linear mixed model that includes genetic relatedness via ancestral information: non-genetic effects that reflect the experimental design and a residual model that accommodates spatial dependence. Such analyses have been widely accepted as they have been found to produce accurate predictions of both additive and total genetic effects, the latter providing the basis for selection decisions. In this paper, we present the results of a case study of 34 early-stage trials to demonstrate this type of analysis and to reinforce the importance of including information on genetic relatedness. In addition to the application of a superior method of analysis, it is also critical to ensure the use of sound experimental designs. Recently, model-based designs have become popular in Australian plant breeding programs. Within this paradigm, the design search would ideally be based on a linear mixed model that matches, as closely as possible, the model used for analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of models for design generation that include information on genetic relatedness and also include non-genetic and residual models based on the analysis of historic data for individual breeding programs. At present, the most commonly used design generation model omits genetic relatedness information and uses non-genetic and residual models that are supplied as default models in the associated software packages. The major reasons for this are that preexisting software is unacceptably slow for designs incorporating genetic relatedness and the accuracy gains resulting from the use of genetic relatedness have not been quantified. Both of these issues are addressed in the current paper. An updating scheme for calculating the optimality criterion in the design search is presented and is shown to afford prodigious computational savings. An in silico study that compares three types of design function across a range of ancillary treatments shows the gains in accuracy for the prediction of total genetic effects (and thence selection) achieved from model-based designs using genetic relatedness and program specific non-genetic and residual models.

J	Ning, LT; Guo, R				Ning, Lutao; Guo, Rui			Technological Diversification to Green Domains: Technological Relatedness, Invention Impact and Knowledge Integration Capabilities	RESEARCH POLICY												Climate changes and ecological challenges often motivate firms to diversify into environmental domains. However, this does not guarantee impactful inventions. Therefore, this study investigates how firms can create impactful environmental inventions based on their technological relatedness and prior knowledge integration capabilities. Using a unique dataset of 1,990 high-tech Chinese firms between 2006 and 2016, our results reveal that diversifying firms' green technological relatedness has an inverted U-shaped relationship with invention impact. While the depth of firms' knowledge integration capabilities steepens this relationship, the breadth flattens it. Higher levels of depth capability result in a greater impact, while greater breadth leads to an early attainment of peak invention impact at a lower degree of green technological relatedness. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach The study uses a conjoint experimental design to reveal the structure of respondents' decision policies. Data were gathered from 47 useable replies from corporate entrepreneurs and were analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Findings Results show that product relatedness, market relatedness, perceived certainty about expected outcomes and slack resources all have a positive effect on the willingness of a corporate entrepreneur to pursue a new venture idea. Moreover, slack was found to diminish the positive effect of product relatedness on the likelihood to pursue a venturing opportunity. Practical implications By providing a better understanding of decision-making schemas of corporate entrepreneurs, the findings of this study help improve the practice of entrepreneurship at the organizational level. In order to make more accurate opportunity assessments, corporate entrepreneurs need to be aware of their cognitive strategies and need to factor in the salient criteria affecting such assessments. Originality/value This paper adds to the limited understanding of corporate-level decision-making with regard to pursuing venturing opportunities. More specifically, the paper adds new insights regarding how relatedness and uncertainty affect new venture opportunity assessments in the presence (or lack thereof) of slack resources.

New guidelines for choosing priority areas of economic diversification based on a system of situational centers	EKONOMIKA I MATEMATICESKIE METODY-ECONOMICS AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS												One of the important management functions of the situation center system is to ensure planning (strategic, medium term, and operational), which includes justification of goals, optimal allocation of resources to achieve the goals, taking into account economic complexity, evolutionary conditionality and innovation activity. There is no universal solution to promote economic development and structural change. It is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of the regions when developing and designing industrial and economic policies. An approach to assessing priority areas of diversification based on recommendations for the development of sectors is presented. The approach is focused on increasing the economic complexity of the regional economy, taking into account the evolutionary conditionality of its development, the impact of innovative activity of regions and the provision of sectors with resources. Its capabilities have been tested for 14 sectors of the economy of the Belgorod region on 2019 data. For each sector, estimates were obtained according to six criteria. The priority sectors when choosing the direction of diversification of regional economy, are those the characterisrics of which have the priority of Pareto optimality in the considered multiple choice problem. The implementation of the proposed approach using digital technologies in regional situation centers can ensure coordination of decisions taken by regions when choosing priority areas of diversification in order to increase economic security. The methodology used makes it possible to take into account and display in real time and in the initial information considered by any region the decisions already taken by other regions, which is an urgent task for the system of situational centers.

The model provides an approach to incorporate the relatedness literature within the mainstream theoretical frameworks of endogenous growth and economic geography. Each firm's technology sector and the location of other firms play a role in each firm's ability to improve its own technology. As a result, firms prefer to co-locate in technologically compatible clusters. Without relying on scale assumptions, the model for the first time coherently links related variety knowledge spillovers to mainstream urban economic frameworks and demonstrates that clustering is possible in both core and peripheral areas.

A significant number of children regularly attend Christian education in church and yet there is limited research investigating how those programs support children's faith. Guided by self-determination theory, this research investigates whether instructional practices can support children's religiosity and relationship with God. The present study specifically assessed whether children's perceived relatedness with adults and peers in church, and children's perceived autonomy in Sunday school, predicted children's religiosity and relationship with God. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to identify if the church variables were significant predictors of an identified relationship to God. Neither perceived relatedness in church nor perceived autonomy in Sunday school were significant predictors of identified religiosity. However, perceived relatedness in church did significantly predict relationship with God.

This procedure is used to disambiguate in a particular domain of context and represent in an ontology query language, natural language expressions. The ontology query language that we use is the SPARQL. The construction of the queries is automated and also dependent on the semantic relatedness measurement of ontology concepts.

The performance of existing approaches to computing semantic relatedness is highly dependent on particular aspects of relatedness. For instance, taxonomy-based approaches aim at computing similarity, which is a special case of semantic relatedness. On the other hand, corpus-based approaches focus on the associative relations of words by taking their distributional features into account. Based on the assumption that different aspects of knowledge sources cover different kinds of semantic relations, this paper presents a hybrid model for computing semantic relatedness of words using new features extracted from various aspects of Wikipedia. The focus of this paper is on finding the optimal feature combination(s) that enhance the performance of the hybrid model. The empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets has shown that hybrid features perform better than single features by providing a complementary coverage of semantic relations, leading to improved correlation with human judgments.																			0302-9743		978-3-319-11749-2; 978-3-319-11748-5				2014	8786						523	533																WOS:000345318600039

Therefore, the current study aimed to determine whether the implementation of a single pedagogical strategy, centred within the self-determination theory framework, could effectively address students' innate need for relatedness. Specifically, informal verbal feedback was utilized to enhance teacher-student communication, where the teacher spoke with each undergraduate student individually at the start of every lesson for 1-2 minutes. A total of 243 Advanced Science undergraduates enrolled in the first-year course at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, were included in the study. Seventy-one undergraduates were enrolled in 2016, whereas 172 undergraduates were enrolled in 2017. A mixed research methodology was employed to best leverage the utility of both qualitative and quantitative data. Interestingly, the use of informal verbal feedback as a pedagogical strategy significantly improved the student' perceptions of receiving helpful feedback to aid their learning. These findings are important as they emphasize the utility and effectiveness of implementing one new pedagogical strategy to facilitate student' motivation, by enhancing feelings of relatedness.

J	Petty, CS; Eddy, CM; Pratt, SS				Petty, Clinton Scott; Eddy, Colleen M.; Pratt, Sarah Smitherman			Examining mathematics teacher motivation during lesson study: the role of contextual factors for perceived relatedness	LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH												Motivated teachers are more likely to exhibit enhanced interest, persistence, and confidence when engaged in professional development (PD); yet, facilitators often neglect teacher motivation when implementing PD. Self-determination theory suggests that social and environmental contextual factors influence the psychological need of relatedness which promotes motivation. Therefore, PD facilitators could enhance teacher motivation by emphasizing supportive factors when asking teachers to participate in novel learning activities. We drew on self-determination theory for this qualitative case study to examine eight secondary mathematics teachers' perceptions of relatedness when participating in lesson study (LS). Our results derive from semi-structured interviews, journal entries, and field notes. Analysis of data indicated that positive interpersonal dynamics and collective agency reflected contextual factors that increased perceived feelings of relatedness while negative interpersonal dynamics reduced perceptions of relatedness. Participants who experienced satisfaction of relatedness through supportive contextual factors credited them as increasing their learning during LS. Conversely, members who reported less relatedness satisfaction via negative interpersonal dynamics expressed various degrees of learning. Those perceiving interpersonal conflict reported diminished learning while participants experiencing substantive conflict reported increased learning. Understanding social and environmental factors shaping relatedness could guide PD facilitators who seek to promote teacher motivation during LS.

J	Naudé, W				Naude, Wim			From the entrepreneurial to the ossified economy	CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS												Entrepreneurship in advanced economies is in decline. Instead of becoming 'entrepreneurial', as was anticipated in the 1990s, today, these economies are better described as ossified.This paper starts by documenting the decline in entrepreneurship. It then critically discusses extant explanations for the decline. While having merit, these explanations are restricted to proximate and supply-side causes. Given these shortcomings, an additional perspective is contributed: it is argued that adverse scale effects from rising complexity, and long-run aggregate demand changes, account for the ossification of advanced economies. Implications for entrepreneurship scholarship are drawn.

Emotional Intelligence as Mediator between Need for Relatedness, Happiness and Flourishing	SUSTAINABILITY												The psychology of sustainability and sustainable development aims to study the personal characteristics that promote effective and sustainable well-being for individuals and environments from a psychological research perspective. According to the self-determination theory, the psychological need for relatedness is positively associated with happiness and flourishing. In turn, emotional intelligence, i.e., understanding and managing one's own emotions and recognizing others' emotions, may play a key role in this association. Therefore, the present study investigates the mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between need for relatedness and both happiness and flourishing. Basic Psychological Needs scales (BPNs), Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS), Flourishing Scale, and Happiness Scale were administered to 216 Italian participants (age range 15-66 years old). A mediation model via a structural equation model for path analysis was tested. The results showed that the psychological need for relatedness positively associated with both happiness and flourishing and that emotional intelligence mediated these associations. These results suggest that important interventions may be performed to promote flourishing and happiness, enhancing emotional intelligence through specific training differently from need for relatedness that, instead, can be considered substantially stable.

J	Frenken, K; Neffke, F; van Dam, A				Frenken, Koen; Neffke, Frank; van Dam, Alje			Capabilities, institutions and regional economic development: a proposed synthesis	CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY												The capability framework in evolutionary economic geography views regional economic development as a process of related diversification through the acquisition of capabilities that render a regional economy more complex. Using this framework, we synthesize seven theoretical notions that hitherto remained rather disconnected: relatedness, complementarity, variety, complexity, diversification, agents of structural change and related variety. We formulate a constructive critique of the capability framework, relaxing the overly restrictive assumption that the presence of capabilities in a region is both necessary and sufficient for complex products to be produced in a region. Instead, we argue that the complexity of a regional economy depends primarily on the institutions that support firms to coordinate production in complex value chains within and across regions. The augmented framework allows for closer integration of evolutionary and relational approaches in economic geography, providing new links between the literature on clusters, innovation systems and global production networks.

The present study proposes a framework that is based on regional workplace knowledge and skills which are good proxies of regional capabilities. In this regard, it evaluates the SS priorities of regions with respect to their industry spaces built upon regional skill bases characterised by skill relatedness and skill complexity measures. By doing so, it analyses to what extent SS strategies are built on regional capabilities and strengths. It shows that regional heterogeneity plays an important role in the SS policy design. High-income regions tend to prioritise industries in which they have enough capabilities, while low-income regions opt for new production paths.

Innovation actors are required to respond quickly to a new situation bearing in mind the effects of actions across their network of partners and competitors as well as rising economic complexity. Indeed, first indications suggest that this pandemic is no different and has facilitated the use of digital technologies. In order to assess these develop-ments, this paper studies new service offerings based on digital technologies using the example of three major Russian banks. We found that banks have now developed into technology platforms that use their experience to engage in areas like education, advanced robotics, and health care. Technologies developed by partner organiza-tions, such as the integration of blockchain solutions, have spread rapidly. Thereby, banks have obtained a strategic advantage for launching innovations in the financial in-dustry, including technology and knowledge transfers from other industries.

We found in a case study of the oil-dependent Stavanger region in Norway that plants in industries that are skill-related to the dominant oil and gas industry showed lower employment growth than plants in other industries. This was the case both in the boom and the crisis periods, even when controlling for supply linkages to the oil and gas sector. However, we also found that plants skill-related to the oil and gas industry increased their relative performance during the crisis to some degree, but they did not outperform the non-skill-related plants during the crisis.																			0308-518X	1472-3409				JUN	2022	54	4					676	692	0308518X211066102	10.1177/0308518X211066102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308518X211066102		DEC 2021											WOS:000736657400001

There are also two main types of datasets, those intended for similarity evaluations and those intended for relatedness. Although they are clearly distinct, they are similar enough to generate some misconceptions. Is there a confusion between similarity and relatedness among the semantic measure community, both the designers of SMs and the creators of benchmarks? This is the question that the research presented in this paper tries to answer. Authors performed a survey of both the SMs and datasets and executed a cross evaluation of those measures and datasets. The results show different consistency of measures with datasets of the same type. This research enabled us to conclude not only that there is indeed some confusion but also to pinpoint the SMs and benchmarks less consistent with their intended type.

Unpacking relatedness	INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION												There is ample evidence of regions diversifying in new occupations that are related to pre-existing activities in the region. However, it is still poorly understood through which mechanisms related diversification operates. To unpack relatedness, we distinguish between three mechanisms: complementarity (interdependent tasks), similarity (sharing similar skills) and local synergy (based on pure co-location). We propose a measure for each of these relatedness dimensions and assess their impact on the evolution of the occupational structure of 389 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) for the period 2005-2016. Our findings show that new jobs appearing in MSA's are related to existing ones, while those more likely to disappear are more unrelated to a city's jobs' portfolio. We found that all three relatedness dimensions matter, but local synergy shows the largest impact on entry and exit of jobs in US cities, thus being the strongest force of diversification.

Drawing on data from a qualitative study with children aged 7-12 in the north of England, the authors identify five interconnected ways in which children made sense of kinship. They explore how children understood genealogical kinship conventions, creatively deployed or interpreted kin terms, and defined some unrelated others as 'like family'. The interplay between children's creative agency and adults' involvement in children's kinship is considered.

J	Wong, R				Wong, Ruth			Basis psychological needs of students in blended learning	INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS												Traditional classroom setting has transitioned from a solely face-to-face, teacher-oriented instructional approach to an integrated, mixed-mode classroom learning dynamic. With this change of educational context, it is imperative to know: are students' basic psychological needs being better met and fulfilled? To address this question, this paper adopted a mixed method to discover if, and how, blended learning meets students' three basic psychological needs, specifically relatedness, competence and autonomy. Findings show that the first two need-constructs of relatedness and competence were fulfilled. The need for autonomy, however, was not being met due to school culture, assessment and the perhaps-habitual adherence to the conventional roles of teachers and students. This study also found that the three aforementioned psychological are positively related. In fact, blended learning has provided a new dimension of, and opportunity for, learning interactions for students of differing learning styles. Varieties of academic outputs released other expressions of "self" in many students, which enabled the first need for relatedness to be met. Blended learning outputs could bring a positive spiral of development of recognition from others, and meet the second need of competence later, leading to better identity formation, and ultimately again to relatedness.

J	ElMassah, S; Hassanein, EA				ElMassah, Suzanna; Hassanein, Eslam A.			Economic Development and Environmental Sustainability in the GCC Countries: New Insights Based on the Economic Complexity	SUSTAINABILITY												The economic development and environmental sustainability nexus have long been a fiercely debated issue. Researchers have widely acknowledged the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis when evaluating this relationship. Recently, an emerging strand of research examined the EKC through the lens of the Economic Complexity Index (ECoI) as a broader measure of economic development. However, empirical evidence of the index's environmental impact is still limited. Despite its growing prominence, no prior research has been conducted in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) using the ECoI, particularly in the EKC context. Furthermore, research comparing the ECoI differentiated impacts on Ecological Footprint and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions is largely lacking. Extending on this line of research, our investigation intends to ascertain the influence of ECoI, income, globalization as well as non-renewable energy consumption on two dominant environmental pressure metrics: CO2 emissions and ecological footprint per capita (EFpc) within the EKC hypothesis context in six GCC countries during 1995-2018. To this end, Pedroni's cointegration approach was conducted to examine the long-term association between variables; cointegration coefficients were analyzed using Dynamic and Fully modified OLS. Our investigation indicates the emergence of an inverted U-shaped link between ECoI and environmental sustainability in the GCC region for both CO2 emissions and EFpc. Furthermore, according to the individual country analysis, our findings demonstrate that the EKC hypothesis is sensitive to both the environmental degradation indicator used and the country analyzed; such that the quadratic link incorporating ECoI is confirmed for Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait when EFpc is employed. In comparison, it holds for Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar when CO2 emissions are used. Moreover, the findings show that income per capita and non-renewables consumption significantly harm environmental sustainability, however, in terms of EFpc only. In contrast, through its three sub-dimensions, globalization contributes to the environmental burden by increasing both EFpc and CO2 emissions. These conclusions emphasize the economic complexity's dominant role in mitigating environmental pollution in GCC beyond a certain threshold. Finally, the paper reaches a concise set of implications. Among the foremost, the GCC nations could enhance their environmental sustainability by diversifying their energy sources and increasing reliance on renewable sources, encouraging investment in carbon-reduction technologies, converting their economy from energy-intensive to technology-intensive, as well as imposing strict environmental laws to enable globalization to improve environmental quality.

The present paper aims to expand this literature by investigating the effect AfT flows on financial development. The empirical analysis draws on an unbalanced panel dataset of 121 countries over the period 2002-2019, and uses primarily the two-step system Generalised Method of Moments estimator. Empirical outcomes show that total AfT flows exert a positive effect on financial development. The magnitude of this positive effect is greater, the lower the share of manufactured exports in total merchandise exports, or the lower the level of economic complexity. The magnitude of this positive effect is also greater, the lower the size of real net foreign direct investment inflows in the AfT beneficiary countries. These findings highlight the key role of AfT flows in promoting financial development in beneficiary countries, and therefore, in fostering economic development in these countries.																			1363-7029					SEP	2023	28		2				1	38																WOS:001112838500004

Existing WordNet-based approaches fail in the case of non-dictionary words, jargons, or some proper nouns. Meaning of terms evolves over the years which have not been reflected in WordNet. However, WordNet cannot be ignored as it considers the semantics of the language along with its contextual meaning. Hence, we propose a method which uses data from Wikipedia and WordNet's Brown corpus to calculate semantic relatedness using modified form of Normalized Google Distance (NGD). NGD incorporates word sense derived from WordNet and occurrence over the data from Wikipedia. Through experiments, we performed on a set of selected word pairs, and we found that the proposed method calculates relatedness that significantly correlates human intuition.																			2367-3370	2367-3389	978-981-13-2514-4; 978-981-13-2513-7				2019	43						143	154		10.1007/978-981-13-2514-4_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-2514-4_13													WOS:000759490500013

Drawing upon the concepts of adaptation/adaptability, the analysis investigates the relatedness of new industrial specialisations to the existing industrial structure before and after a shock occurrence. Evaluating the resilience of Italian provinces in relation to the economic crisis of 2008, the analysis aims to understand if provinces that resisted and recovered better followed a smart specialisation framework where new industrial specialisations are related to the existing industrial structure.																			1695-7253	2340-2717					2022		54																						WOS:000885978200004

Drawing on detailed data on the spatial distribution of 126 population groups in the USA, this paper applies the so called spatial relatedness approach to provide a comprehensive analysis of the aggregate patterns of the US geography of immigration. The first part confirms the central assumption behind this approach that the spatial relatedness between immigrant groups (determined on the basis of their joint concentrations in the same spatial units) significantly correlates with some other measurable aspects of their relatedness. The second part of the analysis then compares the patterns and determinants of the spatial relatedness at the whole US level and within key immigrant metropolitan areas (New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta) and uses the spatial relatedness measures to construct network visualisations that provide unique models of the population structure of these individual spatial systems.

Next, we consider how changes in the local industrial mix brought about by China's market reforms influence the ability of different types of firms to benefit from technological-related spillovers. The findings highlight the important role that technological relatedness has on increasing firm productivity, providing some support for the idea that regions should pursue a strategy of 'regional branching' to evolve the local industrial mix into related economic activities. The findings also reveal, however, that increasing technological relatedness may asymmetrically harm underperforming firms and widen disparities in productivity between local firms.

Existing approaches to computing semantic relatedness ignore the asymmetric associations of words. In the absence of an explicit topical context, these asymmetric associations can be effectively used to represent the relation of words in directional contexts. Motivated by the idea of word associations, this paper presents a new approach to computing semantic relatedness using asymmetric association based probabilities of words extracted from the directional contexts of words based on the Wikipedia corpus. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach on a variety of publicly available benchmark datasets shows that the asymmetric association based measures outperformed not only the baseline symmetric measures but also most of the state-of-art approaches.																			0302-9743		978-3-319-11749-2; 978-3-319-11748-5				2014	8786						512	522																WOS:000345318600038

In a panel of prefectural cities and industries, spanning the years 1999-2007, we employ instrumental variables to identify the effect of increasing local wage levels. We find adverse effects on performance of (low-skilled) labor intensive industries in China's advanced regions. Consistent with cost-saving industry relocation, such industries expand in other locations, where wages are comparatively low. Comparing locations where such industries expand to those where they do not, we find that both economic complexity and subsequent per capita income increased faster in the former group.

Most previous contributions rely on CO2 emissions as a measure of environmental damage, whereas using disaggregated ecological footprint allows us to consider resource consumption and waste generation compared to nature's resource generation and waste absorption. The empirical application is based on a panel data analysis for G7 countries from 1980 to 2018. The results indicate that the EKC hypothesis is confirmed for the ecological footprint overall, but the impact of GDP growth is unequal across its components. Long-term elasticities point to renewable energy generation significantly improving environmental sustainability. Globalization also decreases pollution indicators, while economic complexity seems to contribute to environmental degradation.

Upstream-downstream relations across technologies are found using citations as proxies, and the key enabling technologies and knowledge complexity are defined accordingly, integrating three principles of S3 that were formerly analyzed separately in the literature. The average propagation lengths model in production theory, which captures long-term and indirect linkages, is then utilised to improve the measure of relatedness across technologies in the current literature. The S3 domains of Lombardy, Italy, are re-examined, and suggestions are made regarding previously 'undiscovered gems'.

Abundant evidence has identified the adaptive role of self-compassion on multiple intrapersonal outcomes, such as mental health, emotional well-being and improvement motivation. However, relatively few is known about self-compassion's interpersonal/social benefits, especially in adolescents. The present study examined the relationships between self-compassion, satisfaction of relatedness, general trust, and prosocial behavior in a relatively large Chinese high school adolescent sample (N = 3238, 47.8% boys; M-age = 15.66 years, SD = 0.80). We observed that self-compassion was positively associated with adolescents' prosocial behavior, and that relatedness and trust mediated the positive association. Moreover, we found that boys maintained a slightly higher level of self-compassion than girls, and multi-group analysis showed that the relationship between self-compassion and trust was also slightly greater in boys than girls. The present study sheds light on how self-compassion is associated with positive social behavior in adolescents. We suggest that self-compassion intervention could be adapted and implemented during this critical developmental period. More research is encouraged to further discover the adaptive functions of self-compassion in social context.

J	Yan, HF; Wang, QH; Ke, Y; Wang, J				Yan, Haifeng; Wang, Qihu; Ke, Yi; Wang, Juan			Explaining business excellence in Chinese firms: how does institutional relatedness matter?	CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES												Purpose It is widely accepted that business excellence comes from firm-specific factors. However, it is still unclear how institutional relatedness - the degree of embeddedness with the dominant institutions that confer resources and legitimacy, influences the business excellence of the firm. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of three kinds of institutional relatedness, i.e. home government ties, initial public offerings (IPOs) and alliances with foreign firms, on the business excellence of Chinese firms. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a sample of firms enlisted on the "Most Respected Companies" rank in China during the period 2002-2015 and their paired firms who are absent from the list, by means of ordinary least square regression estimator, to explore the relationship between institutional relatedness and business excellence. Findings The empirical results suggest that IPOs and alliances with foreign firms significantly strengthen firms' business excellence. Furthermore, home government ties have positive effects on outbound IPOs and alliances with foreign firms but hinder business excellence. Originality/value This study extends the business excellence literature by characterizing institutional rather than firm-specific factors from an institution-based view. It also enriches research on outcomes of institutional relatedness through investigating empirically its impact on business excellence. The findings provide new insights into the dual role of home government ties in achieving business excellence.																			1750-614X	1750-6158				APR 2	2021	15	2					263	289		10.1108/CMS-08-2019-0295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CMS-08-2019-0295		OCT 2020											WOS:000590724000001

To gather data, 65 teachers were surveyed; from this initial group, 11 were interviewed and observed in class during 2012. The results show that teachers' potential to promote motivation is mostly centered on relatedness and that while teachers recognize the positive and beneficial effects of promoting autonomy and competence, their teaching practices do not evidence those beliefs. Based on the results, we conclude that in order to promote autonomy and competence, it is important, first of all, to establish the right social conditions, i.e. meaningful teacher-student relationships.

We find that the intensity of transnational and domestic patent introduction both have an inverted U-shaped relationship with local innovation capacity. Also, the relatedness and similarity of domestic technology introduced are advantageous to local innovation. However, the transnational introduced technologies are only beneficial if they perform similarly to the local knowledge base while having no significant effect if merely showing relatedness.

Objectives: This study investigates students' perceptions of how learning analytics (LA) can be used to support the design of a BL environment in order to promote students' basic need for relatedness, which is a dimension of motivation. Hence, it is hypothesized that sharing LA trends with students and illustrating which course adaptations were performed based on these trends, will result in positive student perceptions and can support students' basic need satisfaction for relatedness. Methods: A quasi-experimental intervention study was executed using a mixed-method approach (N = 257 students) in a BL course in university-based teacher education. The intervention focuses on three types of learning management system LA data (general, content, and background) that are actively used by the instructor. General data consists of generated time on task, content data deals with the content of a learning path and background data includes information about students' previous education. Results and Conclusions: The results show that students' perceptions regarding these LA are positive and most in favour of content data. Moreover, the qualitative data illustrate that students acknowledge the potential value of LA for stimulating relatedness.

By making explicit the semantics of the term, ontology-based semantic measures play a crucial role to determine how different ontology classes have a similar meaning. In this context, it is common to use semantic similarity as a basis for WSD. However, the measures generally consider only taxonomic relationships, which affects negatively the discrimination of two ontology classes that are related by the other relationship types. On the other hand, semantic relatedness measures consider diverse types of relationships to determine how much two classes on the ontology are related. However, these measures, especially the path-based approaches, has as the main drawback a high computational complexity to be calculated in query execution time. Also, for both types of semantic measures, it is unpractical to store all similarity or relatedness values between all ontology classes in memory, especially for large ontologies. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on semantic neighbors that aim to improve the query time in path-based semantic measures without losing their effectiveness in relatedness analysis. We also propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the semantic distance between two ontology classes. We evaluate our proposal in WSD using a pre-existent domain ontology for well-core description. This ontology contains 929 classes related to rock facies and a set of sentences from four different corpora about geology in the Oil&Gas domain. In the experiments, we compared our approach with state-of-the-art semantic relatedness measures, such as path-based, feature-based, information content, and hybrid methods regarding the F-score, query time and the total number of classes in memory. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtains F-score gains in WSD, as well as an improvement in the query time concerning the traditional path-based approaches. Also, we reduce the total number of classes stored in memory for each ontology class.

J	Redondo, R; Valor, C; Carrero, I				Redondo, Raquel; Valor, Carmen; Carrero, Isabel			Unraveling the Relationship between Well-Being, Sustainable Consumption and Nature Relatedness: a Study of University Students	APPLIED RESEARCH IN QUALITY OF LIFE												Many empirical studies have found an association between sustainable consumption and well-being. However, the direction of causality between these constructs remains unclear. Well-being could be an antecedent of sustainable consumption or, sustainable consumption a driver of well-being; also, there could be a reciprocal relationship between these two constructs. Alternatively, both well-being and sustainable consumption could be outcomes of another construct that could be masking a relationship between well-being and sustainable consumption. This study aims to advance the well-being and sustainable consumption research by testing these three relationships in a longitudinal study with young consumers (n = 369). The findings show that when controlling for the constructs at Time 1, the relationship between the focal constructs is no longer significant. Results lead to support the hypothesis that sustainable consumption and well-being are explained by a particular trait of the individual, nature relatedness, so that individuals with greater nature relatedness are more likely to adopt a sustainable lifestyle and have greater well-being. Nature relatedness thus acts as a predictor of both focal constructs. This result implies that by nurturing nature relatedness, societies will achieve the double dividend of well-being and sustainability.					; Carrero, Isabel/O-5594-2015	Redondo Palomo, Raquel/0000-0001-9908-0132; valor, carmen/0000-0002-4864-1048; Carrero, Isabel/0000-0001-6306-3672													1871-2584	1871-2576				APR	2022	17	2					913	930		10.1007/s11482-021-09931-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11482-021-09931-9		APR 2021											WOS:000640155800001

This study examines how students from different minority groups perceive the social-cultural relationships with other groups, whether they feel relatedness, and what characterizes their perceptions regarding being a minority or majority within and outside the college. The research paradigm is qualitative and the genre is phenomenological. The participants are 50 students from various minority groups from 7 teacher education colleges. The results show that most participants report good relationships with students and lecturers from other ethnic groups, which leads to a deep sense of relatedness in the college. Among Ethiopian and Arab students, social connections in the college form mostly with students from the same ethnic group. Among Arab students, the sense of relatedness draws from interactions with friends from the same culture and from studying in Arabic. Our findings indicate distinct views among Arabs and Jews regarding being a minority or majority. The Jewish students defined the terms minority and majority mostly in quantitative terms, while Arab students referred to their social meaning, considering themselves as an underprivileged minority outside the college but as a majority in the college. In general, the results show that colleges facilitate caring conditions, detached from the reality outside the college. The findings have implications on the role of teacher education colleges in promoting equal opportunities and a sense of relatedness among their students, both within the college and in the general society.																			1938-8926	1938-8934				AUG	2022	15	4					493	504		10.1037/dhe0000288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000288													WOS:000826182000011

Currently, service registries support only human classification, which results in limited recall and low precision in response to queries, due to keyword based matching. The syntactic features of a service along with certain semantics based measures used during classification can result in accurate and meaningful results. We propose an approach for web service classification based on conversion of services into a class dependent vector by applying the concept of semantic relatedness and to generate classes of services ranked by their semantic relatedness to a given query. We used the OWLS-tc service dataset for evaluating our approach and the experimental results are presented in this work.

This study investigated whether collaborative animal care in biology lessons affects students' feelings of relatedness toward their biology teachers positively during the first year after the school transition. Four hundred twenty fifth graders (M-age = 10.5 years, SDage = 0.6 years) of higher types of tracking participated. We designed one experimental group that involved caring for the living animals to be used in the upcoming lessons, and two control groups. The first control group included lessons with living animals, but did not include prior care of those animals, and the second incorporated neither living animals nor prior care. All groups received biology lessons with the same content. To examine the effects of caretaking, we used an adapted version of the scale "relatedness" (Ryan 1982). In both control groups, boys showed lower relatedness toward female teachers and girls toward male teachers, respectively.

In this research, we propose a novel structural-fitting method that utilizes the linguistic ontology into vector space representations. The ontological information is applied in two ways. The fine2coarse approach refines the word vectors from fine-grained to coarse-grained terms' (word types), while the coarse2fine approach refines the word vectors from coarse grained to fine-grained terms. In the experiments, we show that our proposed methods outperform previous approaches in seven publicly available benchmark datasets.																					978-1-4503-4918-5				2017							2151	2154		10.1145/3132847.3133152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3133152													WOS:000440845300241

The findings reveal that both relatedness density and knowledge complexity play a positive role in explaining digital industry innovations. However, the relationship between relatedness and knowledge complexity and its interactive effects on innovation performance are less straightforward. In our study, we found that efficient cooperation between relatedness and complexity can only be achieved if the level of government intervention is moderate. Therefore, the discussion of S3 focuses on more than the dichotomous argument between relatedness and unrelatedness. Many socio-economic factors also impact the effectiveness of these theoretical components within different innovation systems, which are largely overlooked by present studies.

Maritime cluster relatedness and policy implications	TRANSPORT POLICY												Despite existing debates on the maritime cluster's institutional composition, geographical boundary, or evolutionary patterns, few studies have empirically scrutinized the relatedness of industrial sectors inside a maritime cluster. This study aims to develop an industry-relatedness model to quantitatively measure the paired industry relatedness among three maritime sectors: port-related, shipping-related, and maritime business services. Maritime sectors can be labour-intensive or capital-intensive, and thereby we constructed a compound ratio of capital per capita to address the heterogeneity issue in evaluating the industry relatedness. Instead of focusing on a specific maritime cluster, we applied the model to three representative maritime clusters, namely Western Europe, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), to enhance the generalizability of our findings and implications. Findings suggest that the maritime cluster in Western Europe is characterized by more inter-sector connections. In Western Europe, Ship owning and operating, and Ship management and agency are found to operate with the highest relatedness; GBA has a polarized maritime industry structure with Hong Kong specializing in Ship finance and Shipbroking; cities in YRD operate with a speciality in Shipbuilding and repairing. This study found that differences in industry relatedness are mainly attributable to the focal region's evolutionary history and governance structure. We also provided a valuable reference for policymakers to plan and improve local and regional maritime cluster development.					Lai, Kee-hung/B-4054-2009; Lun, Y.H.

POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES												Recent studies in evolutionary economic geography (EEG) highlight the key role of industry relatedness and cognitive proximity in boosting firm performance using data from developed countries. This paper explores the effect of industry relatedness on new firm survival in China by using a firm-level dataset for the 1999-2008 period. Based on survival models, it contributes to the ongoing debate by pointing out that new firms that are highly related to local industries have a lower failure rate, and the effect of industry relatedness is inflected by regional institutions and firm attributes. Industry relatedness occurs more effectively in the market-oriented regions but less effectively in regions with strong economic and political incentives of local governments.

In this paper, we proposed a method, rsIT, based on a small given set of top conference (pivots) and a relatedness measure based this set as well as basic baseline methods using citation count and field rating. We experimented with a snapshot dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph together with conference data from Microsoft Academic Search. We evaluated the conference ratings from our methods with the CCF conference rating list. We showed that rsIT correlates well with CCF rating and correlates better than ratings from using a baseline ranking with citation count or field rating.

Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is an approach to calculate semantic relatedness between terms or documents based on similarities to documents of a reference corpus. Here, usually Wikipedia is applied as reference corpus. We propose enhancements to ESA (called Extended Explicit Semantic Analysis) that make use of further semantic properties of Wikipedia like article link structure and categorization, thus utilizing the additional semantic information that is included in Wikipedia. We show how we apply this approach to recommendation of web resource fragments in a resource-based learning scenario for self directed, on-task learning with web resources.					Steinmetz, Patrick R.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a dataset of 689 acquisitions completed in the period 2007-2013 by acquirers located in 60 countries, this paper utilizes an ordered logistic regression analysis. Findings - With greater target country unfamiliarity, acquirers are encouraged to pursue greater acquirer-to-target relatedness. This finding suggests that acquirers tend to seek a balance between product and international diversification to reduce the sources of uncertainty in their acquisition moves. While past international experience strengthens this relationship, diversification experience has a negative moderating effect and hence encourages acquirers to reduce relatedness at increasing market unfamiliarity. Originality/ value - The originality of this paper is twofold. First, the authors extend the traditional internationalization-diversification framework to an unfamiliarity-relatedness relationship in the context of acquisitions. Second, the authors propose a construct of target country unfamiliarity in acquisitions that goes beyond the traditional domestic vs cross-border dichotomy by including previous experience in the target country.

Multilevel modeling was applied in this secondary analysis to examine how science self-concept, school relatedness, and science teaching quality predicted student science achievement at both the student and classroom levels. Data from a total of 14,291 grade 8 students in the USA were included in the study. Results showed that after accounting for gender and SES (control variables), self-concept was a statistically significant, positive predictor of science achievement at the student level. At the classroom level, classroom-mean self-concept and sense of relatedness were both statistically significant, positive predictors of science achievement. Students' perceived teaching quality was not a statistically significant predictor at either the student or classroom level. Implications of these results for science teaching and learning are discussed.

Theoretical Constituents of Relatedness Need Satisfaction in Senior Executives	HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY												This qualitative research interviewed 22 C-level executives to explore the theoretical constituents of relatedness need satisfaction, suggested by literature as a predictor of individuals' motivation, behavior, and well-being, for the first time in a sample of senior executives. Joint activity, time, continuity, and common concern were identified as components of how senior executives conceptualized relatedness need satisfaction. This novel research investigated relative importance of the theoretical constituents and senior executive participants ranked common concern as the most important constituent indicator of their relatedness need satisfaction. The results are compared to Baumeister and Leary's (1995) seminal conceptualization of relatedness need satisfaction which was based on a meta-analytical approach of nonexecutive sample studies. This research has both applied and theoretical implications. Our new theory of the constituents of relatedness need satisfaction in senior executives further provides an evidence basis for the design of efficacious practical organizational applications, such as raising senior executives' effectiveness through executive development programs focusing on common concern, joint activity, time, and continuity experiences. Our findings also provide a theoretical framework offering direction for future research in the field of senior executive psychology focused on further improving optimal functioning.

This paper examines the relationship between trade shocks and new industry entry at the regional level. Results show that US urban counties experiencing greater Chinese import penetration are more likely to develop new industries. From an evolutionary perspective, these trade shock-induced new industries may bring new growth opportunities to the local economy. It is also found that the positive impacts of trade shocks on industry entry are enhanced by industry relatedness. This suggests trade shock-induced industrial branching is also path dependent and can be influenced by the pre-existing industry structure of a region.																			0034-3404	1360-0591					2017	51	12					1749	1760		10.1080/00343404.2016.1245415	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2016.1245415													WOS:000415624100002

Participants were 523 students (girls 280, boys 243; mean age = 11.26 +/- 0.31) and the data were collected using self-reports and waist-worn accelerometers. The key findings were: (a) competence and social relatedness need satisfaction at baseline (T0) predicted total MVPA at T1 via total MVPA at T0; (b) in-class MVPA at T0 predicted total MVPA at T1 via total MVPA at T0; (c) in-class MVPA was directly associated with total MVPA at T0 and T1; and (d) boys scored higher than girls on competence and relatedness need satisfaction at T0. These findings indicate that the need satisfactions for competence and social relatedness in PE are central components facilitating the greatest increases in total MVPA participation. To improve student outcomes, it is essential that all children receive positive and satisfying PE experiences. Enhancing the readiness and capability of pre- and in-service teachers through teacher training programmes is vital to raising awareness of the basic psychological need satisfactions behind autonomous motivation and greater MVPA engagement.

J	Nash, C				Nash, Catherine			Genetics, Race, and Relatedness: Human Mobility and Human Diversity in the Genographic Project	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												The National Geographic Society's Genographic Project to reconstruct the geography of early human migration through analysis of the genetic material of indigenous people features a geographical imagination of human interconnection and diversity and differentiated human mobilities. It combines its central focus on human genetic difference with a simultaneous insistence on the progressive value of its explicitly antiracist message about shared human origins and interconnections. An apparently progressive language of multiculturalism, diversity, global human harmony, and indigenous rights frames reductive versions of relatedness, unreflexive assumptions of scientific authority, and primitivizing accounts of exotic and isolated indigeneity. Through its focus on bio-political geographies of difference, this article provides a productive contribution to critical geographies of race and a scholarly engagement with new genetic geographies of human diversity in academic geography. It is also a starting point for a political-pedagogical project that uses the Genographic Project against itself as a resource for an alternative critical exploration of race and relatedness.																			0004-5608	1467-8306					2012	102	3					667	684		10.1080/00045608.2011.603646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2011.603646													WOS:000303109900009

Alliances and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are distinct vehicles for governing inter-firm resource combinations. Prior studies on the governance choice between them have relied on firm- or dyad-level attributes to explicate the choice firms make about the governance. However, any firm or dyad is a micro-structure embedded in networks that shape the flow of information and resources to the focal firm or dyad. In addition, although alliances and mergers and acquisitions involve either horizontal or vertical resource combinations, the vertical dimension of resource relatedness has been largely neglected in prior research. This study examines the impact of structural embeddedness and vertical resource relatedness on governance choice. We find that structural embeddedness is an important driver of governance choice and that a significant portion of resource combinations occurs along the vertical dimension of relatedness.

J	Li, J				Li, Jun			Momentum or Deceleration: The Effect of Previous Change	JOURNAL OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT												A conventional consensus on organizational change is the momentum view, which claims that prior changes of a given kind increase the probability of a subsequent change of the same kind. This consensus has been recently challenged by the deceleration view, which argues that prior changes decrease the probability of a subsequent change. By making a distinction between experienced changes and internalized changes, this study postulates that the two views complement and coexist with each other. A change of a given kind is less likely to occur with more experienced changes of the same kind, while it is more likely to occur with more internalized changes of the same kind. This integrated view is supported in a sample of 477 U.S. local governments making decisions about whether to outsource public services during 1982-2007. This study also looks into how relatedness to internalized changes affected the occurrence of a subsequent change of the same kind. The impact of operational relatedness was positive at an early time and increasingly negative in the long run. The impact of skill relatedness, however, was positive and steadily increased as time went on. MAD statement An important debate on organizational change is how prior changes of a given kind affect the probability of a subsequent change of the same kind. Whereas the momentum view claims that prior changes breed a subsequent change, the deceleration view contends that prior changes prevent a subsequent change. By distinguishing between experienced and internalized changes, this study argues and demonstrates, with a sample of U.S. local governments, that the two views complement and coexist with each other. A change is less likely to occur with more experienced changes, while it is more likely to occur with more internalized changes.

J	Stefancic, M				Stefancic, Mitja			A new framework for the analysis of contemporary financial markets: the need for pluralistic approaches	JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL ECONOMICS												Interdisciplinary approaches are essential to properly evaluate an economic and financial system that is increasingly complex and globally interrelated. With reference to the work of the philosopher Peter Godfrey Smith, it is argued that a more pronounced interdisciplinarity in the social sciences would enable a flourishing of pluralism in economics. By adopting clearly defined research strategies and objectives, scholars with different academic backgrounds can successfully work on common projects. A better integration of economic, social and behavioural sciences will favour the establishment of new frames of thinking and new analytical tools which are much needed in contemporary financial regulation. Financial markets, defined as competitive markets in financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, loans and derivatives, represent a research subject that may be analysed from a plurality of angles and frames, including a sociological one. In practice, such a plurality of perspectives could favour sustainable wealth creation and contribute to maximizing the benefits from economic globalization.																			1843-2298	1844-8208				FAL	2009	3	1					90	107																WOS:000214551900005

In this study, we introduce CASIA-TAR, an active tourist attractions recommendation system, which provides relevant knowledge of specific tourist attractions and make recommendations for other relevant places to visit based on semantic relatedness among the specific tourist attraction and potentially interesting places. Two algorithms are introduced to calculate the semantic relatedness among different tourist attractions based on the tourist attraction semantic knowledge base with relevant knowledge mainly extracted from Web-based encyclopedias. As an integrated portal for tourist attraction recommendation, CASIA-TAR also provides images, news and microblog posts that are relevant to specific tourist attractions so that visitors could obtain relevant information in an integrated Web-based system.					zeng, yi/KFS-5661-2024; Zhang, Tielin/AAA-8567-2019	Zhang, Tielin/0000-0002-5111-9891; Zeng, Yi/0000-0002-9595-9091													0302-9743		978-3-319-09912-5; 978-3-319-09911-8				2014	8610						263	273																WOS:000349148900022

In this paper, a novel method was proposed to tackle the problem by expanding the features of short text based on Wikipedia and Word2vec. Firstly, build the semantic relevant concept sets of Wikipedia. We get the articles that have high relevancy with Wikipedia concepts and use the word2vec tools to measure the semantic relatedness between target concepts and related concepts. And then we use the relevant concept sets to extend the short texts. Compared to traditional similarity measurement between concepts using statistical method, this method can get more accurate semantic relatedness. The experimental results show that by expanding the features of short texts, the classification accuracy can be improved. Specifically, our method appeared to be more effective.

In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient Gaussian process (GP) modelling framework, mTGP(mk), that can explicitly model domain relatedness and adaptively control the space as well as the strength of knowledge transfer. mTGP(mk) takes both the discrepancy of input feature space and the discrepancy of predictive function into account in the transfer procedure. Specifically, mTGP(mk) adaptively selects a good latent manifold shared by different domains, and utilizes a parametric similarity coefficient to measure the predictive function covariance of different domains in this manifold. The latent shared manifold and the similarity coefficient are jointly learned in a coupled manner. By doing so, mTGP(mk) maximizes the strength of the shared knowledge transfer by choosing the transfer space with the best transfer capacity. More importantly, mTGP(mk) exploits a succinct and computationally efficient manifold learning approach so that it can be well trained with scarce target training data. Extensive experimental studies using 36 synthetic transfer tasks and 10 real-world transfer tasks show the effectiveness of mTGP(mk) on capturing the relatedness and the transfer adaptiveness.

Further, in three selected regions (Munich, Dusseldorf and Oberes Elbtal/Osterzgebirge), the knowledge space is explored in detail and compared to existing smart specialisation strategies. Average relatedness and knowledge space based upon EPO patent applications are used to measure the specialisation and technology trajectories of the German regions. Between three periods 1988-1992, 1998-2002 and 2008-2012, the specialisation of Germany based on EPO patent applications increased by 10%', despite a decline in many regions. Machinery and transportation industries have increased their significance. The assessment of regional smart specialisation strategies in the three German states shows that the methodology in terms of the identification of prospective industries is largely variegated and insufficiently developed. More attention should also be given to the choice of an appropriate geographical level of aggregation for analysis. Knowledge relatedness and knowledge complexity could be used as methodological tools for selecting prospective industries in smart specialisation strategies.																			1210-8812						2018	26	2					95	108		10.2478/mgr-2018-0008	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/mgr-2018-0008													WOS:000436774900002

We argue that acquirers endowed with heterogeneous learning capabilities can alter the shape of the trade-off to their favour. In particular, we focus on a notion of industry relatedness that captures the coherence between the domains of operation of the acquirer and the acquired firm. Using a longitudinal dataset of 1,736 domestic acquisitions in the Netherlands, we show that the heterogeneous learning capabilities of the acquirers alter the shape of the inverted-U relationship, according to first- and second-order moderating effects. Our results confirm that learning capabilities by internal R&D and by acquisition experience both improve what acquirers can achieve in innovative performance when industry relatedness is at the point of balance between exploration and exploitation. In contrast, they have opposite implications on the potential losses in innovative performance when industry relatedness is outside the point of balance: internal R&D increases the tolerance of the trade-off, smoothing out potential innovation losses, whereas acquisition experience reduces it.

The research involved target audiences who followed micro-celebrities on Instagram in Taiwan and employed quota sampling to distribute questionnaires on the social media platform. Four hundred eighteen valid samples were collected in the spring of 2022 and analyzed with structural equation modeling. The empirical results indicate that the main path was from homophily through relatedness need satisfaction to brand attachment (HOM -> RNS -> BA). Regarding relatedness need satisfaction as a mediator variable, homophily had a greater impact on brand attachment than benign envy. Moreover, this study is the first to expand the effects of emotional connection to brand attachment while showing that homophily and attractiveness positively impact brand attachment through benign envy and relatedness need satisfaction in micro-celebrity endorsements.

J	Celo, S; Chacar, A				Celo, Sokol; Chacar, Aya			International coherence and MNE performance	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES												We introduce the concept of International Coherence (IC) to describe the degree of relatedness in a multinational enterprise (MNE). We propose that IC hinges on the interplay of the relatedness between any two MNE units and the linkages that tie them together. Linkages can be thought of as the often costly "pipes" that allow the "content", that is, resources and information that define relatedness, to "flow". We argue that greater IC increases the potential of an MNE to generate economies by facilitating resource sharing and diffusion, as well as learning and knowledge creation among MNE units while controlling corresponding bureaucratic costs. In turn, this will lead to superior MNE performance. We also hypothesize that firms facing high levels of competition will have greater incentives to capitalize on IC. To test our hypotheses, we first estimate the relatedness between units by the revealed unit relatedness using data on nearly a half a million global investments by all public MNEs worldwide. We then use this information and data on 960 US MNE units' locations to estimate IC and find support for our hypotheses. Our results indicate the potential for IC as an important new facet of multinationality.																			0047-2506	1478-6990				JUN-JUL	2015	46	5					620	628		10.1057/jibs.2015.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/jibs.2015.4													WOS:000356106400006

We begin by explaining and demonstrating that the overall degree of BMD has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. We next highlight the particular role that demand relatedness plays in BMD. We first provide evidence that the inverted U-shaped relationship flattens in times of financial shocks, consistent with arguments that the benefits of BMD from consumers' willingness-to-pay for simultaneous use of multiple business models may diminish during shocks. Second, we argue that firms tend to sequence the addition of new business models based on demand relatedness, and we provide evidence that the degree of demand relatedness between a core and a target business model enhances the likelihood of diversification into that target business model.

We present a new exploratory search approach that generates interactive visualizations of query concepts using thematic cartography (e.g. choropleth maps, heat maps). We show how the approach can be applied broadly across both geographic and non-geographic contexts through explicit spatialization, a novel method that leverages any figure or diagram - from a periodic table, to a parliamentary seating chart, to a world map - as a spatial search environment. We enable this capability by introducing explanatory semantic relatedness measures. These measures extend frequently-used semantic relatedness measures to not only estimate the degree of relatedness between two concepts, but also generate human-readable explanations for their estimates by mining Wikipedia's text, hyperlinks, and category structure. We implement our approach in a system called Atlasify, evaluate its key components, and present several use cases.

INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS												What will happen if students cannot go to school and can rely on online learning? This study aimed to examine whether students' basic learning needs could be met when teaching and learning can only be conducted through online mode. According to Ormrod (2011), the four basic learning needs are arousal, autonomy, relatedness and competence, which were used as the theoretical framework for this study. Mixed methods were used to evaluate whether basic learning needs were met. A total of 118 school students were recruited to a validated questionnaire and 36 of them joined an individual in-depth interview. Results showed that the basic learning needs of autonomy and competence were met through online learning but not the need of relatedness. Autonomy was found to have direct relationship with competence but not relatedness nor there was any relationship between arousal and other learning needs. It was so found that positive and adequate negative arousal could serve as a catalyst to facilitate effective online learning.

Getting beyond relatedness as a driver of corporate value	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Our paper scrutinizes how corporate value derives from redeployability of firms' resources to new product markets. We focus on the underexplored determinant of redeployability, inducements, defined as advantages in returns in new over existing markets. We assemble separate dimensions of inducements from research on corporate diversification and real options and consider inducements in their entirety. A simulation model casts redeployability as a real option to switch the use of resources across markets and explicates important interdependences among the dimensions of inducements. The model also demonstrates that inducements modify the effect of relatedness on corporate value. Our theoretical arguments amend existing theory and have important implications for corporate diversification research.

Exposing students to nature has been a common practice in environmental education for nurturing this connection among students. However, this exposition is not always feasible, especially in the context of higher education, nor is it clear that exposure to nature engenders nature connectedness equally among students. Thus, there are calls for a greater understanding of the psychological factors that may impinge on greater nature relatedness so to identify complementary educational routes for nurturing this interdependent construal. Responding to these calls, in a sample of 967 students, we examine whether character strengths covariate with nature relatedness and which character strengths better differentiate between high and low levels of nature relatedness. Our results show thatintellectual character strengths(i.e. appreciation of beauty, love of learning, and curiosity) are strongly associated with nature relatedness. Moreover, our findings show that appreciation of beauty is the strongest covariate of nature relatedness. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for environmental education.

The findings showed that on average, parents thought that their children would advocate for more rights than their children actually did. Mothers were more likely than fathers to believe that their child would advocate for self-determination rights. Older adolescents used more diverse reasoning categories than younger adolescents in their decision making. There was no age difference in the adolescents' support of nurturance and self-determination rights. Parents were generally given authority over moral consideration, but less over conventional and personal conventions.

J	Escandell, S; Chu, TL				Escandell, Sthephany; Chu, Tsz Lun (Alan)			Implementing Relatedness-Supportive Teaching Strategies to Promote Learning in the College Classroom	TEACHING OF PSYCHOLOGY												Introduction Relatedness-a sense of meaningful connectedness and belonging-is one of the basic psychological needs proposed by self-determination theory. Statement of the Problem The current literature lacks evidence-based strategies that support student relatedness in the college classroom. In education, research has indicated what strategies support relatedness, but not how to implement this well-established and important concept in the college classroom. Literature Review Self-determination theory suggests that supporting relatedness between the instructor and students, and among students, can foster intrinsic motivation, internalization of extrinsic motivation, and performance in educational settings. Teaching Implications We present four evidence-based relatedness-supportive strategies-facilitating learning connections, preventing student self-silencing, providing and receiving feedback, and developing a student-centered classroom-to help promote greater student engagement and success in the classroom. We also share our examples and experiences applying these strategies as an instructor and an undergraduate teaching assistant in a physiological psychology course. Conclusion Feedback from students and our reflections suggest that the four strategies are effective, which can be adopted and adapted by other instructors to implement in their classrooms.

J	Freire, C				Freire, Clovis			Economic diversification: A model of structural economic dynamics and endogenous technological change	STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS												Economic diversification is relevant for poorer developing countries to create jobs and foster economic development. The empirical economic literature has identified several stylized facts about the pattern of diversification of economies, but the development of explanations for those patterns, in general, has been only loosely associated with an economic theory on growth, trade, technology change and structural transformation. Making that connection is relevant because it could inform policymakers in developing countries in designing and implementing policies for promoting diversification. This paper presents a model of structural economic dynamics and endogenous technological change that can replicate empirical regularities related to economic diversification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Relying on data from a panel of Chinese cities, we show that the level of capabilities available to domestic firms operating in ordinary trade is an important driver of economic growth. However, no direct gains emanate from the complexity of goods produced by either processing-trade activities or foreign firms. This suggests that the sources of product upgrading matter, and that domestic embeddedness is key in order for capacity building and technology adoption to be growth enhancing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Cohorts and Relatedness: Self-Determination Theory as an Explanation of How Learning Communities Affect Educational Outcomes	RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION												This study examines whether feelings of relatedness constitute a substantial means by which learning communities (cohorts) improve learning outcomes in higher education. It applies Ryan and Deci's Self-Determination Theory to an analysis of the National Survey of Student Engagement. The SDT hypothesizes that environments that support perceptions of social relatedness improve motivation, thereby positively influencing learning behavior. The authors propose that participation in cohort programs constitutes such an environment. Measuring student perceptions of the contributions of their institutions, the study found increased relatedness to peers and faculty and increased higher order thinking assignments (a control variable included in the research model) to be substantial predictors of educational outcomes relevant to literacy, critical thinking, and, especially, job preparation. The researchers suggest that institutions will want to ensure that their learning community designs enhance student feelings of relatedness.																			0361-0365	1573-188X				DEC	2011	52	8					853	874		10.1007/s11162-011-9221-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11162-011-9221-8													WOS:000296639300005
J	Butz, NT; Stupnisky, RH				Butz, Nikolaus T.; Stupnisky, Robert H.			A mixed methods study of graduate students' self-determined motivation in synchronous hybrid learning environments	INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION												The purpose of this multiphase mixed methods study was to apply Deci and Ryan's (1985) self-determination theory in an investigation of the relationships among students' need satisfaction, motivation, and achievement in synchronous hybrid learning environments (i.e., simultaneously teaching on-campus and online students using webconferencing). The results from Survey 1 indicated that online students reported significantly lower levels of relatedness than their on-campus counterparts. Follow-up interviews were conducted with purposefully chosen students and faculty members. The findings suggested that four themes impact synchronous hybrid learning: peer relatedness, technology influence, instructor impact, and program structure. In vivo quotations were used to develop a scale to assess participants' self-efficacy of relatedness development. Survey 2 data indicated that the new scale had good psychometric quality and that students reported significantly greater levels of self-efficacy for relatedness development with classmates in their same attendance mode than with peers in the opposite format.

Analogous to ordinary web search techniques, ESA also suffers from the redundancy issues due to the ongoing expansion of the amount of Wikipedia entries. Entries redundancy could lead to biased representation that lay particular emphasis on semantics from a large number of similar entries. On the other hand, original ESA for SR has a weak point that it does not consider the correlations or similarities between the Wikipedia articles of the text representations. To tackle these problems, We develop a novel method to cluster the redundant or similar entries by similarity measurement based on Paragraph Vector (PV), a neural network language model. Results of experiments on four datasets show that our framework could gain better performance in relatedness accuracy against ESA.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-25255-1; 978-3-319-25254-4				2015	9313						647	657		10.1007/978-3-319-25255-1_53	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25255-1_53													WOS:000365948500053

Using data on 700 SIC5 industries across 174 NUTS3 regions in the UK between 2000 and 2014, we provide evidence of positive complementarities between industrial path dependence and regional-related variety for firm entry in rooted pre-existing industries. These are negative for entry of pioneering firms in industries new to the region, pointing to lock-in effects and the role of unrelated variety in fostering linkages and knowledge spillovers away from established trajectories.																			1468-2702	1468-2710				MAY 19	2022	22	3					631	652		10.1093/jeg/lbab021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbab021		OCT 2021											WOS:000763988500001

Though increasing greatly in numbers, shorter sojourn has not been the focus of attention. With regard to the adjustment of sojourners, research has tended to stress situational factors rather than personality. This study is different in terms of focusing on short term educational sojourn of Western students in a Majority World country and examining the effect of personal characteristics and cultural evaluation of the sojourners on their experience. Relatedness and country of origin were found to influence the cultural experience of exchange students through their cultural evaluation at baseline. Students with higher relatedness orientation had more positive cultural evaluations at baseline which then led to a more positive cultural experience in the receiving country.

Receiving social support plays an important role in satisfying the need for relatedness. Following job crafting theory, the present study aims to examine (1) whether searching for social support results in an increase in the satisfaction of the need for relatedness and (2) whether this effect is mediated by an increase of received social support from the school principal and from colleagues. Using longitudinal data (N = 1071) we calculated residualized change scores and applied structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized mediation model. Results confirmed the beneficial effect of searching for social support on the satisfaction of the need for relatedness. This effect included a direct effect and an indirect effect through the receipt of social support from colleagues. The receipt of social support from the school principal was positively related to searching for social support but was unrelated to the satisfaction of the need for relatedness. These findings emphasize the importance that teachers build strong and supportive relationships within the school team, as this helps to satisfy their need for relatedness, which in turn contributes to better wellbeing among teachers.

Relatedness, industrial branching and technological cohesion in US metropolitan areas, Regional Studies. Work by evolutionary economic geographers on the role of industry relatedness for regional economic development is extended into a number of methodological and empirical directions. First, relatedness is measured as the intensity of input-output linkages between industries. Second, this measure is employed to examine industry evolution in 360 US metropolitan areas. Third, an employment-weighted measure of metropolitan technological cohesion is developed. The results confirm that technological relatedness is positively related to metropolitan industry portfolio membership and industry entry and negatively related to industry exit. The decomposition of technological cohesion indicates that the selection of related incumbent industries complements industry entry and exit as the main drivers of change in metropolitan technological cohesion.

We present an implementation of this conceptual model, which captures the semantics of description elements based on linguistic and information theory concepts.

J	Rusch, H				Rusch, Hannes			Ancestral kinship patterns substantially reduce the negative effect of increasing group size on incentives for public goods provision	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY												Numerous theories on the evolution of altruistic in-group beneficial behavior in humans exist. Many of these abstract away from the effects of kinship on incentives for public goods provision, though. Here, a simple model is devised that illustrates how genetic relatedness changes the incentive structure of that paradigmatic game which is conventionally used to model and experimentally investigate collective action problems: the linear public goods game. Using recent anthropological data sets on relatedness in contemporary hunter-gatherer and horticulturalist societies the parameters of the model are estimated. It turns out that the kinship patterns observed in these societies substantially reduce the negative effect of increasing group size on incentives for public goods provision. It is suggested, therefore, that renewed attention should be given to inclusive fitness theory in the context of public goods provision also in sizable groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Romania, as a member state of the EU, by 2007 January 1st, benefited from its status, in this type of restructuring transactions. Considering a sample of 192 acquisitions, with one target and one acquirer, in which a Romanian company was involved, either in the position of the acquirer or of the target, we consider a number of financial ratios describing both companies, their degree of relatedness and the type of M&A (domestic or cross-border) as predictors for the amount of investment that the acquirer made in the target company. The analysis will consider all the transactions, but also the two main NACE categories (industry and services). Using a mediation model, the results will show that the workforce ratio, the productivity ratio and the relatedness of the two companies have a significantly influence in the percentage purchased in the target company, but the national/international side of the M&As lead to an increase in the capacity of the proposed models to predict the variance of the final investment.

Secondary data transcriptions derived from focus groups involving 20 final-year pre-registration nursing undergraduates at an academic institution in Hong Kong which directly examined their placement reflections and views were analyzed against the states of relatedness and process or social competences identified within this theory. Data from the study provided evidence to support every state of relatedness and process or social competency within the theory of human relatedness. Evaluating pre-registration nursing student placement experiences against this theory suggests that improving a practicum may necessitate creating conditions for workplace learning which more effectively foster connectedness, belonging, reciprocity, mutuality, and synchrony, minimize the need for parallelism and help prevent disconnectedness and enmeshment.																			2538-1032						2023	24	2																						WOS:001025945500004

Instead of relying on direct overlap the algorithm uses Hindi WordNet hierarchy to learn semantics of words and exploits it in the disambiguation process. Evaluation is performed on a sense tagged dataset consisting of 20 polysemous Hindi nouns. We obtained an overall average accuracy of 60.65% using this measure.

In this context, little attention has yet been drawn to the effect of industrial relatedness, which refers to the similarity and complementarity of business activities. We examine 1,855 domestic M&A deals announced between 2002 and 2008 in the Netherlands, and we assess the extent to which geographical proximity and industrial relatedness affect M&A partnering. Our study shows that geographical proximity drives domestic M&A deals, even at very detailed spatial scales like the municipality level. We also found evidence that companies that share the same or complementary industries are more likely to engage in an M&A deal. Logistic regressions show that the effect of industrial relatedness is stronger than the effect of geographical proximity and that the effect of geographical proximity is stronger in unrelated than related target selection.																			0040-747X	1467-9663				DEC	2015	106	5					608	624		10.1111/tesg.12141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tesg.12141													WOS:000368331100007

Specifically, the emission of carbon dioxide has caused irreparable harm to human health and the planet's ability to sustain life. To meet the urgent demand for sustainable development, this study evaluates the influence of economic complexity (ECI), renewable energy consumption (RENE), and financial development (FD) on CO2 emissions in N-11 countries from 1995 to 2019. For this purpose, we use several preliminary tests for examines the characteristics of the data, and panel quantile regression (PQR) and the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) for analyses the heterogenous relationship between the variables. The empirical outcomes confirm the presence of EKC hypothesis in N-11 countries. Results also shows that financial development has positive impact on CO2 emissions, whereas the combine effect of financial development and renewable energy consumption (FD*RENE) on carbon emissions is negative. Based on the empirical outcomes, this study suggests that there is a possibility that improved financial infrastructure will exacerbate environmental damage, despite the fact that this is generally advantageous.

Similarly to interactions with physical objects, users may assign virtual objects with value, experience a sense of relatedness, and develop psychological ownership over these objects. The objective of this study is to understand how AR's unique characteristics influences the emergence of meaning and ownership perceptions amongst users. We conducted a study of users' interactions with a virtual dog over a three-week period, comparing AR and fully virtual settings. Our findings show that engagement with the application is a key determinant of the relation users develop with virtual objects. However, the effect of the background layer- whether physical or virtual-dominates the development of relatedness and ownership feelings, highlighting the importance of the "real" physical layer in shaping users' perceptions.																					978-1-4503-5970-2				2019										10.1145/3290605.3300921	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300921													WOS:000474467908070
J	Meissner, BL; Bantjes, J				Meissner, Birte Linda; Bantjes, Jason			Disconnection, reconnection and autonomy: four young South African men's experience of attempting suicide	JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES												Although young men are considered to be at particular risk of completing suicide in South Africa, very little is known about the reasons for this, or the way in which young men understand their own suicidal behaviour. In this study we set out to explore and describe the subjective experiences of four young South African men who had previously attempted suicide. Interviews were conducted and transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Participants' accounts of suicidal behaviour revealed a struggle for relatedness and autonomy. Two major themes were identified: (1) 'Turning away from others and self', which describes how participants disconnect from close others and from self, prior to attempting suicide as an act of autonomy; and (2) 'Returning to self and others', which describes the process of healing and recovery from being suicidal through re-connecting with others and gaining a healthy sense of autonomy. The findings are discussed using the framework of autonomy-relatedness proposed by Kagitcibasi.

Mert			The uneven geography of innovation in Turkey: Visualizing the geography and regional relatedness of patent production	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE												Economic geography studies revealed that regional economies are heavily dependent on path-dependent network-based complexities. Innovation and technology are the key concepts for regional economic growth and the uneven geography of innovation is quite decisive for the regional stability of the countries. In this regard, the network topology of the regional relatedness of patent production is embedded on unequal population cartograms in order to better display the uneven geography of innovation in Turkey. The study reveals that the geography of the patent production has a dynamic pattern that it spreads from patent-producing hubs to their surrounding regions that have never produced. Besides, an increasing variety of classes indicates that new technologies are emerging in some regions. Istanbul covers almost 60% of the patent production of the country. There are around 10 industrialized secondary hub regions existing which the two out of them (Adana and Gaziantep, cities of the east closest to the West and Mediterranean zone) are located in eastern Turkey. Eastern regions have medium size connections with the western hub regions which they are attaching to existing major nodes.					Cubukcu, K. Mert/P-2316-2019; Erdem, Umut/AIC-9077-2022	Cubukcu, K.

Regional Studies. This paper applies economic complexity analysis to the Australian sub-national economy (nine regions with 506 exported goods and services). Using a 2009 Australian multi-regional input-output table for base data, we determine the number of export goods or services in which each state and territory has a revealed comparative advantage, and visualize the complexity of Australia's interstate and international exports. We find that small differences in industrial capability and knowledge are crucial to relative complexity. The majority of states (especially Western Australia) export primarily resource-intensive goods, yet interstate trade has many complex products that are not currently internationally exported.

Semantic similarity and semantic relatedness are interchangeable terms, in Semantic relatedness all types of semantic relationships are considered i.e. (has, part-of contains etc.) whereas in semantic similarity only "is-a" type of relationship is used. Computing accurate similarity improves the efficiency of query processing and understanding of textual data more proficiently. In this work, a novel hybrid approach of corpus based and knowledge based method is proposed approach to compute the semantic relatedness among words. In this hybrid method, Latent semantic analysis is used to find the concepts and their correlation value and mapping is done for different words with the help of fuzzy formal concept analysis. To compute semantic relatedness on different words a fuzzy set similarity measure is used.The proposed approach has been evaluated on solar domain and attains improved results as compared to other baseline measures. This method can be used for any doamin as it is a generalized approach for similarity computation. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Cetorelli, N; Jacobides, MG; Stern, S				Cetorelli, Nicola; Jacobides, Michael G.; Stern, Samuel			Mapping a sector's scope transformation and the value of following the evolving core	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Research Summary: A surprisingly neglected facet of sector evolution is the evolutionary analysis of firms', and thus a sector's, scope. Defining a sector as a group of firms that can change their scope over time, we study the transformation of U.S. banking firms. We undertake a sectoral, population-wide study of business-scope transformation, with particular focus on which segments banks expand into. As financial intermediation evolved, a continuously shifting set of activities became associated with "core banking," with scope changing and relatedness itself (measured through coincidence) evolving over the banking sector's history. Banks that expand scope while staying close to this evolving core attain net performance benefits. Identification tests show that the benefits of following the evolving core are robust to endogeneity. Managerial Summary: When does it pay to diversify into new segments? Our study looks at the transformation of U.S. banking firms from 1992 to 2006. Drawing on the full population of banks, we show that, as financial intermediation evolved, a continuously shifting set of activities became associated with "core banking." Bank Holding Companies expanded their scope on aggregate, moving in and out of new segments. We find that while entry into new segments is negatively associated with performance improvement, diversification into this evolving core of activities is positively associated with performance improvement. This redefines "related diversification" and its positive value, showing relatedness changes over time, as a function of the evolution of the sector. We find that our results are robust to selection.

Second Language Vocabulary Acquisition: The Effects of Semantic Relatedness, Form Similarity, and Translation Direction	LANGUAGE LEARNING												Characteristics of vocabulary lists as well as study and test translation direction may affect the ease of learning second language (L2) vocabulary. We examined immediate and delayed test performance of first language (L1) English speakers learning a fixed set of L2 vocabulary placed on lists formed by crossing semantic relatedness (unrelated vs. related) with L2 orthographic form similarity (not similar vs. similar). During the study phase, half the participants translated from L2 to L1 and half from L1 to L2; tests were then taken in both directions. Semantic relatedness in the absence of form similarity improved accuracy when the first test taken translated from L2 to L1, and tended to hurt accuracy when the first test taken translated from L1 to L2; it sometimes increased confusion errors. Form similarity usually hurt accuracy and always increased confusion errors. The combination of the L1-to-L2 study direction with the optimal semantic and form conditions yielded the best long-term performance.

J	Hu, YJ; Ye, XY; Shaw, SL				Hu, Yingjie; Ye, Xinyue; Shaw, Shih-Lung			Extracting and analyzing semantic relatedness between cities using news articles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												News articles capture a variety of topics about our society. They reflect not only the socioeconomic activities that happened in our physical world, but also some of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles, and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence often suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the relatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news articles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic relatedness between cities; yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This paper proposes a computational framework which can read' a large number of news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This framework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine learning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the overall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the top 100 US cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory visualizations of the extracted semantic relatedness under different topics and over multiple years. We also analyze the impact of geographic distance on semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed framework can be used to support large-scale content analysis in city network research.

Agency, institutional relatedness and new path development in peripheral regions	CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY												This article develops a framework to understand new industrial path development in peripheral regions based on notions of 'bricolage' and 'institutional relatedness'. While the first stresses the agency of (heterogeneous) actors' resourcefulness and strategic improvisation co-shaping new industrial paths, the latter highlights the transposition of related institutional settings within regions to amplify (or to limit) the search space for new industries. These arguments are used in conjunction to explain the development of an unlikely biotechnology path in the Portuguese Centro region, analysed since its emergence and over a period of more than 10 years.

We argue that mergers and acquisitions are distinct strategies, because of the unique regulatory structure and equity ownership pattern that exists in India. Their choice depends on control considerations on the one hand and regulatory imperatives on the other. Correspondingly, their sources of value creation or destruction do not always correspond to extant theories of synergy or agency. We present a modified synergy story and illustrate that, while related acquisitions create value and non-related acquisitions destroy value, both related and unrelated mergers create value.

J	Sahin, E; Alici, S				Sahin, Elvan; Alici, Sule			An associational study on pre-service early childhood teachers' nature relatedness in education for sustainability	INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION												There is significant global concern with current environmental problems, yet people's behaviour towards the environment has been resistant to change. Young people have the opportunity to bring about desirable changes through environmental behaviours and attitudes. The goal of this study is to better understand the scope of nature relatedness as an attribution interacting with pro-environmental behaviours for Turkish pre-service early childhood teachers. We examined the associations between the domains representing nature relatedness and also sought to identify any differences in nature relatedness with respect to their year of enrolment in a teacher education program. The participants were 402 students attending an Early Childhood Teacher Education Program at one of the two public universities in the capital of Turkey. A Turkish-adapted version of the Nature Relatedness Scale developed by Nisbet, Zelenski, and Murphy was administered to gather the data. Participants were found to have a mostly positive external nature-related worldview. Furthermore, the statistical analysis indicated non-significant differences in their nature relatedness with respect to the year of enrolment in the teacher education program. In terms of the relationships between the constructs representing nature relatedness, the internalized identification with nature was positively correlated with two constructs which refer to his/her physical familiarity as well as attraction to nature, and how individual's relationship with the environment is provoked by his/her behaviour. This research indicates that pre-service teachers, who are regarded as important agents for the future implementation of sustainability education, are actually lacking in their nature relatedness constructs and need to develop key competencies in a field that presupposes that they have already acquired sufficient experience of physical and emotional interaction with nature.

The heterogeneous panel sample set of E7 and G7 countries was considered, and the period of observations was based on annual frequency between 1995 and 2019. To account for endogeneity, the study also included control variables whose impact is in tune with the conventional findings. The empirical outcomes, based on robust estimation techniques, propose a "U" behavior between carbon emissions and international tourist arrivals and between suspended particulate matter and international tourist arrivals. Thus, after a certain rise in the pollution level threshold, international tourist inflows fell significantly in both sets of panel observations. However, this was more pronounced for the E7 countries. Our findings suggest some policy prescriptions that are crucial for sustainable development and the expansion of tourism.

Therefore, the pur-pose of the study is to identify the countries of intellectual leaders in the global market and the factors that influence the positions that countries achieve in terms of leadership. The following research methods were used: multifactor regression models, cluster analysis, and comparative analysis. Based on the authors' methodology for assessing countries' intel-lectual leadership, the clustering of countries in the global economy is determined. The eval-uation algorithm was based on three levels: 1) resources, 2) the intermediate results of intel-lectual activity, and 3) the final results of overall progress. Using a multifactor regression model and cluster analysis, four clusters of countries were iden-tified according to key indicators of intellectual leadership. For each cluster, the specialization of the two countries in terms of merchandise exports was analyzed: cluster 1 - the United States and Germany; cluster 2 - Israel and Italy; cluster 3 - Brazil and Ukraine; cluster 4 - China and South Korea. Each country is assigned an index of economic complexity, and the change in position of each country within a cluster over ten years is noted. An important goal is to understand the determinants of the leadership of countries in each geo- graphic region.The analysis is based on the cluster analysis carried out in previous publications. The clustering of countries was carried out based on the dynamics of macroeconomic indicators over the past 15 years.

Firms' product space evolution is characterised by strong cognitive path dependence that, however, is relaxed by firm heterogeneity in terms of size, efficiency and international exposure. The introduction of new products in laggard Eastern regions, which is importantly linked to the evolution of their industrial output, is mainly affected by firm's internal product-specific resources. On the contrary, product innovations in Western advanced regions hinge relatively more on the availability of local technological-related competencies.						/0000-0002-4942-5486													1468-2702	1468-2710				SEP	2016	16	5					975	1006		10.1093/jeg/lbv024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jeg/lbv024													WOS:000384671700001

We examined the minimum population size, relatedness structure, and genetic diversity of a recently established population of eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) inhabiting New York City (NYC). The population has been established for approximately 25 years, and sample collection for genetic analysis has been ongoing since 2010. We genotyped 234 scat, eight tissue, and three blood samples at nine microsatellite loci. We identified 45 individual coyotes with a male-biased sex ratio of 2.2:1. We also found moderate to high levels of genetic diversity, with average observed heterozygosity of 0.779 and mean number of alleles per locus of 7.8. Most of the green spaces surveyed supported a single group of closely related coyotes in each. Relatedness comparisons between parks also indicated that coyotes compared across different parks were also closely related. We identified two unrelated mated pairs and found no support for polygamy. The high incidence of relatedness suggests that the coyote population is descended from a small number of founding individuals. Additionally, we genetically recaptured several coyotes, including one individual sampled in the Bronx and in Queens, with a median of 103 days between resampling. This result indicates that the coyotes are persisting in some of the isolated greenspaces of New York City and able to move successfully between them.						nagy, christopher/0000-0002-2835-2150; Henger, Carol/0000-0001-7264-7821													1083-8155	1573-1642				APR	2020	23	2					319	330		10.1007/s11252-019-00918-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-019-00918-x													WOS:000520351500009

Ontology-based semantic relatedness for detecting the relevance of learning resources	INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS												Semantic relatedness measures have proven useful for a number of applications, such as querying personalized web resources, word sense disambiguation, or real-word spelling error correction. Most semantic relatedness measures between concepts are based on the concept hierarchy of a domain ontology. In this article, we propose a semantic relevance (SR) measure that expresses the semantic relatedness between a learning resource and the learning context of a learner. In our case, both the learning resource and the learning context are described by graphs using the learning concepts of the domain model. Our SR measure aims to detect the relevance of a learning resource for a particular learning context of a learner. In our work, the SR measure is based on the assignment of relative weights to the learning concepts describing the learning resource according to their relationships with the current concept of interest to the learner. The proposed measure achieves better results than the relatedness measures from the literature and yet is much simpler than most of them. It is shown to achieve a correlation of from 0.627 to 0.945 with expert ratings. This measure is implemented and used in a learning organizer, a system which generates adaptive hypermedia courses and reuses learning resources from distant web repositories, called Organisateur de Parcours Adaptatifs de Formation (OrPAF). In OrPAF, learning resources are annotated in order to be queried for a particular learning context, which is represented by a map of annotated learning concepts, called an adaptive conceptual map. The proposed SR measure is used in order to automatically detect the learning resource relevance.

J	Boschma, R; Heimeriks, G; Balland, PA				Boschma, Ron; Heimeriks, Gaston; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre			Scientific knowledge dynamics and relatedness in biotech cities	RESEARCH POLICY												This paper investigates the impact of scientific relatedness on knowledge dynamics in biotech at the city level during the period 1989-2008. We assess the extent to which the emergence of new research topics and the disappearance of existing topics in cities are dependent on their degree of scientific relatedness with existing topics in those cities. We make use of the rise and fall of title words in scientific publications in biotech to identify major cognitive developments within the field. We determined the degree of relatedness between 1028 scientific topics in biotech by means of co-occurrence of pairs of topics in journal articles. We combined this relatedness indicator between topics in biotech with the scientific portfolio of cities (i.e. the topics on which they published previously) to determine how cognitively close a potentially new topic (or an existing topic) is to the scientific portfolio of a city. We analyzed knowledge dynamics at the city level by looking at the entry and exit of topics in the scientific portfolio of 276 cities in the world. We found strong and robust evidence that new scientific topics in biotech tend to emerge systematically in cities where scientifically related topics already exist, while existing scientific topics had a higher probability to disappear from a city when these were weakly related to the scientific portfolio of the city.

J	Dalgas, KM; Olwig, KF				Dalgas, Karina Marcher; Olwig, Karen Fog			Local and transnational care relations: relatedness and family practice among au pairs in Denmark	GLOBAL NETWORKS-A JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL AFFAIRS												An increasing number of young women from the Global South have become au pairs in the Global North since the turn of the millennium. Through ethnographic analysis of three cases of au pairing in Denmark, involving Filipina and Caribbean women, this article discusses the nature of the local as well as transnational family relations in which these women are embedded as au pairs, and the opportunities and restraints that they present. We use anthropological theory to conceptualize family and kinship in terms of notions and practices of relatedness. This offers a useful framework for elucidating the different moral and contractual obligations and expectations associated with these varying family relations, the power asymmetries with which they are linked, and the agency that the au pairs display as they seek to position themselves in the most favourable way in relation to the multi-directional ties in which they are involved.

Landscape urbanization threatens plant phylogenetic diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Urbanization causes species loss around the world, but its effects on phylogenetic diversity are poorly known in tropical forests. Using a patch-landscape approach in an urbanizing region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we tested whether the increase in landscape urbanization reduces plant species density, phylogenetic richness and divergence, and increases the relatedness among co-occurring individuals and species. We assessed plant responses to urbanization in adult (diameter at breast height > 10 cm) and sapling communities (2.5-10 cm diameter) separately, as saplings are proxies of the future flora. We sampled 2860 woody plants belonging to 155 species in nine circular landscapes with urbanization level varying from 0% to 45%, and estimated the relatedness among the species that have increased and decreased in relative abundance in more urbanized landscapes (winner and losers, respectively). As expected, species density and phylogenetic richness decreased with the increase in urbanization. These responses were consistent for adult and sapling communities, suggesting a persistent loss of species and lineages in more urbanized landscapes. Contrary to our expectations, phylogenetic divergence and structure did not respond to urbanization, indicating that the more urbanized landscapes still retain much evolutionary history. However, because the relatedness among winners was greater than among losers, it is likely that the phylogenetic divergence gradually reduces and the relatedness increases, resulting in impoverished forests with uncertain ability to provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and pest control. This environmental cost should be taken into account to align urban sprawl with biodiversity conservation.

J	Zhu, MY; Zhuang, XL; Ma, GJ				Zhu, Mengyan; Zhuang, Xiangling; Ma, Guojie			Readers extract semantic information from parafoveal two-character synonyms in Chinese reading	READING AND WRITING												In Chinese reading, the possibility and mechanism of semantic parafoveal processing has been debated for a long time. To advance the topic, "semantic preview benefit" in Chinese reading was reexamined, with a specific focus on how it is affected by the semantic relatedness between preview and target words at the two-character word level. Eighty critical two-character words were selected as target words. Reading tasks with gaze-contingent boundary paradigms were used to study whether different semantic-relatedness preview conditions influenced parafoveal processing. The data showed that synonyms (the most closely related preview) produced significant preview benefit compared with the semantic-related (non-synonyms) condition, even when plausibility was controlled. This result indicates that the larger extent of semantic preview benefit is mainly caused by the larger semantic relatedness between preview and target words. Moreover, plausibility is not the only cause of semantic preview benefit in Chinese reading. These findings improve the current understanding of the mechanism of parafoveal processing in Chinese reading and the implications on modeling eye movement control are discussed.

Through an analysis of a sample of 4206 US companies, we find that CVC-backed companies have a longer investment duration and a larger investment amount than IVC-backed companies. Our analysis reveals that geographic distance and industry-relatedness are influential for the success of the company. We show that industry-relatedness is more likely to lead to an acquisition exit while geographic proximity rather fosters IPO exits.

However, studies have not explored how meaningful work can be created for co-op students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between co-op students' perceptions of a learning environment, perceived relatedness of the work experience (to their potential careers and to their academic studies), and self-reported meaningfulness of work. Data were collected from undergraduate co-op students in a Canadian university immediately following a co-op work term. Results from testing a parallel mediation model showed that both forms of relatedness partially mediated the influence of learning environments on self-reported meaningfulness. These findings offer insight into the ways in which work terms can be designed to enhance co-op students' work experiences.

J	Chen, PH; Adesope, O				Chen, Po-Hsuan; Adesope, Olusola			The effects of need satisfaction on EFL online learner satisfaction	DISTANCE EDUCATION												This study explored the effects of need satisfaction (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) on English as a foreign language (EFL) online learner satisfaction and validated the Chinese versions of the need satisfaction scale (NSS) and online learner satisfaction scale (OLSS). We collected data from a questionnaire administered to 199 EFL students at a Taiwanese university. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for NSS was .90 and .91 for OLSS. For NSS, the principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in a three-factor solution that accounted for 61.31% of the variance. Regarding OLSS, PCA resulted in a two-factor solution that accounted for 63.17% of the variance. A multiple regression analysis revealed that three independent variables (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) were predictors of EFL online learner satisfaction (F(3, 191) = 85.14, P < .001, R-2 = .57), with competence the best predictor of online learner satisfaction, followed by relatedness and autonomy. The paper concludes with implications of these results.																			0158-7919	1475-0198					2016	37	1					89	106		10.1080/01587919.2016.1155962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01587919.2016.1155962													WOS:000379593000007
J	Yang, YA; Lütge, C				Yang, Yanan; Luetge, Christoph			Chinese Multinationals' Dynamic Integrations in the Developed Market: From a Resource Dependence Perspective	SAGE OPEN												Integrating the developed-market resources after acquisitions is a crucial tool for Chinese multinational enterprises (CMNEs) to accelerate industrial high-quality development. However, existing theories have scarce thorough explanations of the dynamic mechanism of CMNEs' post-merger integrating resources. Our research aims at disclosing CMNEs' post-merger integration (PMI) long-term dynamics under resource relatedness changes. We applied a multiple-case study with four typical CMNEs' German-market PMI cases and proposed a theoretical framework based on a coding analysis of 38 interviews. Our findings highlight that: CMNEs change initial gentle integrations (partnering/preservation) to balance dependence when pre-merger resources complementary decreases with similarity increasing, or to extreme dependence when pre-merger resources similarity continually increases to extremely high. Pre-merger resource relatedness basics and later changes and CMNEs' dynamic capability (threat and development potentials' perception capabilities and utilization capability) are crucial factors in promoting CMNEs' PMI changes. Our originality lies in that we consider the interactions resource relatedness changes and CMNEs' PMI dynamics, strongly replenishing the deficiency of current PMI dynamic studies that lack considerations of resource relatedness changing; also, we simultaneously consider the two facets of dependence asymmetry and joint dependence such that broadened the application of resource dependence theory (RDT) in PMI studies. Our study offers managerial insights into CMNEs' development leapfrog through acquisitions in developed markets that CMNEs should focus on the vital role of inter-firm resource relatedness changing. Initial gentle integration can be deepened when original resource backgrounds become more similar but should be cautious of the effect of power imbalance and selfish actions. CMNEs' Dynamic PMIs RDT perspectivePurpose-Our study aims to disclose the post-merger integration (PMI) long-term dynamics of Chinese multinational enterprises (CMNEs) under resource relatedness changes from a lens of resource dependence theory (RDT). Methods-We applied a multiple-case study with four typical CMNEs PMI cases and proposed a theoretical framework by a coding analysis of 38 interviews. Conclusions-CMNEs change initial gentle integrations (partnering/preservation) to balance dependence when pre-merger resources complementary decreases with similarity increasing, or to extreme dependence when pre-merger resources similarity continually increases to extremely high. Pre-merger resource relatedness basics and later changes and CMNEs dynamic capability (threat and development potentials perception capabilities and utilization capability) are crucial factors in promoting CMNEs PMI changes. Implications-Our theoretical implication lies in that we strongly replenish the deficiency of current PMI dynamic studies that lack considerations of resource relatedness changing by considering the interactions resource relatedness changes and CMNEs PMI dynamics, and broaden the application of RDT in PMI studies by simultaneously considering the two RDT facets of dependence asymmetry and joint dependence. Our study offers managerial implications for CMNEs to focus on the vital role of inter-firm resource relatedness changing. Gentle integration is not the only choice but can be deepened when original resource backgrounds become more similar. Meanwhile, CMNEs should be cautious of the effect of power imbalance and selfish actions. Limitations-Our case study is relatively small-sized so a large-sample quantitative investigation is needed to verify and test the generalizability of our theoretical framework empirically.

ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING												There is inadequate knowledge about the relationship between financial openness and economic transformation, particularly in the African context. This lack of knowledge fuels the passion for research, especially with the emergence of new refined indicators of both financial openness and economic transformation. The objective of this paper, therefore, is to assess the impact of financial openness on the economic transformation process using as sample sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, with study period spanning from 1995 to 2020. To do so, we use the economic complexity index as an indicator of economic transformation, and the KAOPEN index of Chinn and Ito (2006) to capture financial openness. Based on the Instrumental Variables Two-Stage Least Squares (IV-2SLS) technique, we obtain the following results: Firstly, financial openness is a powerful driver of economic transformation in SSA; secondly, our results remain stable following several sensitivity tests related to economic digitization, financial development, types of natural resources, quality of institutions, historical, cultural, and geographic factors; and finally, our results are robust to the use of alternative measures of financial openness and economic transformation, but also to changes in instrumentation and estimation technique. Consistent with our result, we suggest that policymakers should boost the attractiveness for foreign direct and portfolio investments while maintaining fundamental balances.

J	Afanasiev, MY				Afanasiev, Mikhail Y.			Guidelines for the Diversification of the Regional Economy	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS												There is no universal solution to promote economic development and struc-tural change. It is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of the re-gions when developing and designing industrial and regional economic pol-icy. An approach to assessing the priority areas of diversification of the re-gional economy based on recommendations for the development of sectors is presented. The approach is focused on increasing the economic complexity of the regional economy, taking into account the evolutionary conditionality of its development, the impact of innovative activity of regions and resource availability for sectors. Along with the standard approach to assessing eco-nomic complexity, approximation capabilities are used. Estimates of the prob-abilities of the emergence of new strong sectors in the economy of the region are obtained on the basis of a model that allows us to estimate the probabil-ities of the emergence of new strong sectors using the characteristics of evo-lutionary conditionality. The identification of sectors whose development de-pends on the innovation activity of regions is based on a regression analysis of production volumes on the characteristics of regional differentiation and innovation activity. A condition is described that makes it possible to assess the sufficiency of the resource availability for the sector in the region for its development to the level of a strong one. The possibilities of the proposed approach were tested for 14 sectors of the economy of the Belgorod region on the data of 2019. For each sector estimates were obtained according to six criteria: the economic complexity of the sector; the evolutionary condition-ality of its development to the level of a strong one; the increase in the eco-nomic complexity of the region as a result of the sector development to the level of a strong one on the basis of a standard approach or on the basis of approximation; the dependence of the volume of production of the sector on the innovation activity of the region; the sufficiency of the resource availability of the sector in the region; the growth of GRP in the region. Sectors whose characteristics have the property of pareto-optimality in the task of multi -cri-teria selection are considered as priorities when choosing the direction of di-versification of the regional economy. The implementation of the proposed approach using digital technologies in regional situation centers can ensure coordination of decisions taken by regions when choosing priority areas of diversification.

Therefore, tools for investigating rumor news have become an urgent necessity. One useful function of such tools is to see ways a specific topic or event is represented by presenting different points of view from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose Maester, a novel agreement-aware search framework for investigating rumor news. Given an investigative question, Maester will retrieve related articles to that question, assign and display top articles from agree, disagree, and discuss categories to users. Splitting the results into these three categories provides the user a holistic view towards the investigative question. We build Maester based on the following two key observations: (1) relatedness can commonly be determined by keywords and entities occurring in both questions and articles, and (2) the level of agreement between the investigative question and the related news article can often be decided by a few key sentences. Accordingly, we use gradient boosting tree models with keyword/entity matching features for relatedness detection, and leverage recurrent neural network to infer the level of agreement. Our experiments on the Fake News Challenge (FNC) dataset demonstrate up to an order of magnitude improvement of Maester over the original FNC winning solution, for agreement-aware search.

J	Zhu, SJ; Guo, Q; He, CF				Zhu, Shengjun; Guo, Qi; He, Canfei			Strong Links and Weak Links: How Do Unrelated Industries Survive in an <i>Unfriendly</i> Environment?	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												The evolutionary economic geography strand's emphasis on related diversification as a path for economic development generally leads to greater territorial polarization: places already at the vanguard of production and with more advanced sectors tend to perform better, while less developed, often peripheral places remain stuck in low competitive equilibria. More recently, literature reveals cases where countries/regions may deviate and jump into new, unrelated industries, which have the potential to generate growth and convergence. Nonetheless, we still know little about what happens after jumps into unrelated industries and what factors facilitate the development of such industries. This issue is important, since it is often difficult for unrelated industries to take advantage of local competences and resources, or unfriendly environments. Our first contribution is thus to fill this gap by examining how unrelated industries could survive in an unfriendly environment. Another contribution is to bring the network properties of the industry space to the forefront, and show that unrelated and related industries have distinct preferences in terms of the number and strength of links. The hypothesis is that unrelated industries with a small of number of strong links tend to have better economic performance, while related industries with a large number of weak links are more likely to grow rapidly. We also contribute to the current literature methodologically by developing a new variety indicator that complements the density indicator. The econometric results confirm our main hypothesis.

J	He, CF; Zhu, SJ				He, Canfei; Zhu, Shengjun			EVOLUTION OF EXPORT PRODUCT SPACE IN CHINA: TECHNOLOGICAL RELATEDNESS, NATIONAL/LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL DIVERSIFICATION	TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE												Regions tend to develop new products that are related to pre-existing industrial structure. This stresses the critical role of relatedness in regional industrial diversification. Governments can also strongly affect the evolution of regional industrial structure by using a variety of industrial policies. Based on China's custom product level data, this study explores the evolution of China's export product space during 2000-2011. Econometric analyses suggest that the evolution of export product space in China is heavily driven by relatedness between export products, indicating that regional industrial diversification is path-dependent. Chinese national and local governments can exert significant influence on the evolution of export products by using export and FDI-related policies and by establishing development zones. More importantly, national and local governments have played conflicting roles in China's regional industrial dynamics.

When users raise or inquire questions in Stack Overflow, providing related questions can help them solve problems. Although there are many approaches based on deep learning that can automatically predict the relatedness between questions, those approaches are limited since interaction information between two questions may be lost. In this paper, we adopt the deep learning technique, propose an Attention-based Sentence pair Interaction Model (ASIM) to predict the relatedness between questions on Stack Overflow automatically. We adopt the attention mechanism to capture the semantic interaction information between the questions. Besides, we have pre-trained and released word embeddings specific to the software engineering domain for this task, which may also help other related tasks. The experiment results demonstrate that ASIM has made significant improvement over the baseline approaches in Precision, Recall, and Micro-F1 evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this task. Our model also performs well in the duplicate question detection task of AskUbuntu, which is a similar but different task, proving its generalization and robustness.																			2160-1852		978-1-7281-8710-5				2021							97	107		10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00023													WOS:000693399500011

The recall in concept based search is relatively low. That low recall comes from the fact that it is not easy to represent a concept completely. Query expansion intends to fill a gap because concept representation is always partial. Query expansion improves the recall. In this paper we present an expansion method for a concept based information retrieval. Our method uses semantic relatedness to extend user query through an undirected graph of concepts.

J	Martynovich, M; Taalbi, J				Martynovich, Mikhail; Taalbi, Josef			Dynamic recombinant relatedness and its role for regional innovation	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES												Previous research has argued that related variety enhances regional innovation as inter-industry knowledge spillovers occur more easily between cognitively similar industries. In this study, we engage with empirical operationalization of what is 'related' in related variety. We argue, based on theoretical grounds, that estimating regional knowledge production functions requires related variety measures that capture the recombination of knowledge explicitly. To test this proposition, we develop a set of related variety indicators that account for indirect linkages between industries and allow these linkages to vary over time. Empirically, we estimate the relationship between regional innovation output and regional industry mix in Swedish regions between 1991 and 2010. Our results suggest that related variety measures based on dynamic recombinant relatedness are superior in predicting regional innovation output.

In order to enhance quality of ontology, a vast amount of research has focused on concept modeling task, but there is one major problem with lexical representation of ontology. Current lexical representation is term which may have different meanings, so as to result in frustrating misunderstanding and ambiguity during the application of ontology. To solve this problem, sense is used to replace term as the lexical representation of concepts and properties for its unique meaning. Ontology clarification is the process of disambiguating terms in ontology by using its surrounding ontology elements and its nearby terms in annotated documents using this ontology. The right sense is assigned to a target term by maximizing the relatedness between the target and its neighbors for semantic relatedness between them. Experiments show our ontology clarification method is valid Comparing with the best word sense disambiguation method, the concept precision is almost 2 times than the precision of noun, and the property, precision is almost 3 times than the precision of verb. Another experiment proves that our method is also effective in a semi-automatic process.					fang, jun/KAM-4441-2024; Wang, Xiangdong/AAF-9148-2020																978-1-4244-1650-9				2008							476	481																WOS:000256900300079

Past research has mainly focused on the relatedness and attainability of moral exemplars for predicting motivation outcomes. The data for this study consisted of synthesized data sets from previous studies examining the motivational impacts of distinct moral exemplars and intervention methods. The main syntheses for these data sets used multilevel modeling focusing on relatability, attainability, and intervention methods, corresponding to relatedness, competence, and autonomy in the self-determination theory, respectively, as predictors. In general, there was a significant interaction effect between the attainability or relatability, and the intervention method. Autonomous instruction methods, which support autonomy, were demonstrated to boost motivational outcomes. Implications from this study support the employment of self-determination theory to examine the use of moral exemplars in moral education and were consistent with previous exemplar studies.

J	Catálan, P; Carlos, NCD; Figueroa, F				Catalan, Pablo; Carlos, Navarrete C. D.; Figueroa, Felipe			The scientific and technological cross-space: Is technological diversification driven by scientific endogenous capacity?	RESEARCH POLICY												The principle of relatedness allows us to explore the likelihood that territories diversify their current technological portfolios based on the global co-occurrence patterns of technologies. Countries that excel at developing semiconductors should develop mobile phones because both technologies require similar endogenous capacities, including scientific knowledge. However, thus far, studies have been mostly limited to the knowledge common base assumption and have not questioned enough whether different scientific endogenous capacities may be behind similar diversification performances. To address this question, we introduce the concept of scientific and technological cross-density, which we define as the average proximity of a new potential technology to a country's scientific and technological portfolio. To conceptualize and measure the effect that scientific and technological cross-density may have on technological diversification, we applied a two-stage methodology to a sample of 182 countries during the 1988-2014 period. First, we build a network, the science and technology cross-space, (sci-tech cross-space), which relates knowledge and technologies based on co-occurrence values. Second, we estimate the effect of scientific-technological cross-density and technological density on technological diversification at the country level. We find that the more a new technology is related to a country's scientific portfolio, the greater its entry probability; additionally, the effect of technological density on technological diversification is greater than the effect of scientific and technological density.																			0048-7333	1873-7625				OCT	2022	51	8							104016	10.1016/j.respol.2020.104016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2020.104016		SEP 2022											WOS:000907815300001

The Benefits of Socially-Oriented Happiness: Validation of the Interdependent Happiness Scale in the Philippines	CHILD INDICATORS RESEARCH												Cultural theories of well-being emphasize the importance of establishing and maintaining satisfying interpersonal relationships to achieve happiness in collectivist societies. Yet, widely used measures of subjective well-being have failed to capture the social dimension of happiness. To address this research gap, Hitokoto and Uchida (2015) developed the Interdependent Happiness Scale (IHS), a measure of happiness that was based on interpersonal harmony, quiescence, and ordinariness. The current research assessed the psychometric validity of IHS among Filipino high school students (Study 1) and to examine the incremental validity of interdependent happiness over sense of relatedness in predicting well-being outcomes (Study 2). The results of Study 1 revealed that the hierarchical model of interdependent happiness with relationship oriented happiness, quiescent happiness, and ordinary happiness as first-order factors was applicable for Filipino high school students and the higher-order interdependent happiness construct had stronger predictive impact than each dimension on flourishing and life satisfaction. In Study 2, the hierarchical model of interdependent happiness was also supported and interdependent happiness was found to have incremental validity beyond sense of relatedness in optimizing well-being indices (i.e., flourishing and life satisfaction). The theoretical and practical implications of the results are elucidated.

Simultaneously, trade liberalisation and integration in international production networks were intensified, bringing different export sophistication levels and economic development to countries in this region. This paper aims to examine the real effective exchange rate (REER) impact on the deindustrialisation or reindustrialisation process in 25 post-communist Eastern European countries. The paper employs a heterogeneous panel common factor approach for the period 1995-2018 to exploit the effect of diverse levels of export complexity, stage of economic development and intensity of participation in global value chains on the REER-industrial production relationship. The results establish a heterogeneous yet significant negative relationship between currency strengthening and industrial production. Our findings also indicate that this negative effect of appreciation is less pronounced with the country's higher economic complexity and its broader participation in global value chains.

A diary study among beginning teachers	LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION												An imbalance between work-related stressors and resources, which we refer to as stress exposure, is often found to impair teachers' occupational well-being. However, the psychological mechanisms that explain this relationship are mostly unknown. We assumed that satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness with students, and relatedness with colleagues acts as a mediator. To test this assumption, we conducted a two-week diary study with 152 beginning teachers. A multilevel within-subject mediation analysis showed that teachers felt less work enthusiasm and more emotional exhaustion on days when stress exposure was high. Whereas the needs for competence and relatedness with students explained the association with work enthusiasm, the need for competence mediated the relationship with emotional exhaustion. Additionally, the least experienced teachers felt more emotional exhaustion when the need for relatedness with students was not satisfied. These findings add to our understanding of the daily intra-individual processes affecting beginning teachers' occupational well-being. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Incorporating adverse event relatedness into dose- finding clinical trial designs	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE												Dose-finding designs estimate the dose level of a drug based on observed adverse events. Relatedness of the adverse event to the drug has been generally ignored in all proposed design methodologies. These designs assume that the adverse events observed during a trial are definitely related to the drug, which can lead to flawed dose-level estimation. We incorporate adverse event relatedness into the so-called continual reassessment method. Adverse events that have doubtful' or possible' relationships to the drug are modelled using a two-parameter logistic model with an additive probability mass. Adverse events probably' or definitely' related to the drug are modelled using a cumulative logistic model. To search for the maximum tolerated dose, we use the maximum estimated toxicity probability of these two adverse event relatedness categories. We conduct a simulation study that illustrates the characteristics of the design under various scenarios. This article demonstrates that adverse event relatedness is important for improved dose estimation. It opens up further research pathways into continual reassessment design methodologies.

Mentoring relationships in online classes	INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION												The current study utilized a three-point lagged design to examine the role of mentors during the beginning, middle, and end of undergraduate and graduate-level online courses. Using self-determination theory as a theoretical framework, findings from 358 students show that peer mentor satisfaction at the beginning of the course predicted relatedness mid-way through the semester. Relatedness predicted two facets of online classroom communities, connectedness and learning, at the end of the semester. Learning, in turn, predicted final course grades. Relatedness mediated the relationship between mentor satisfaction and connectedness. The overall pattern of results indicates that mentoring relationships may help students succeed in online classes by meeting core psychological needs.

To this end, we present a toolbox to analyze a region's industrial structure, development prospects and economic resilience that highlights the human capital similarities, or skill-relatedness, among industries. The core of these analyses is the so-called industry space, a network that connects industries with similar human capital requirements. In a case study, we use this toolbox to identify the risks and opportunities for the economic perspectives and resilience of Germany's state Saarland based on the time period 2008 to 2012. This analysis shows that one important concern for this former old-industrial region is that its traditional manufacturing base is almost unconnected in terms of skill-relatedness to the emerging high-technology activities that are central in the region's innovation agenda.																			0034-0111	1869-4179				APR	2014	72	2					133	151		10.1007/s13147-014-0285-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13147-014-0285-8													WOS:000218241400006

Applying lifespan development theory and self-determination theory, we propose that celebrity encouragement of consumer self-determination needs of autonomy (freedom), and relatedness (closeness) in the promotion of strong consumer-celebrity attachment, become less influential as consumers' age. Results of two studies show the bounds of attachment theory and self-determination theory, and brand attachment, as an outcome of celebrity attachment. Findings from Study 1 show that autonomy and relatedness needs encouraged by celebrities become less influential in older consumers attachment to celebrities. Study 2 further identifies that self-determination needs (including autonomy and relatedness) strengthen younger adult consumers attachment to celebrities, which also encourages strong brand attachment when the celebrity is paired with a brand in an endorsement context. This study is important to human brand and brand managers in the development of attachment bonds between consumers and celebrities to strengthen endorsed brand attachment.

However, the impact of the three psychological needs, perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness, on online self-regulated learning remains unclear. This investigated the association between the satisfaction of psychological needs and the six dimensions of online self-regulated learning. This cross-sectional study adopted a quantitative approach. In all, 315 students from four higher education institutions participated in the present study. Students were asked to complete the online questionnaire of psychological need satisfaction and an online self-regulated learning questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the structural relationships between the two. Our study showed that perceived autonomy predicted goal setting, environment structuring, time management, and self-evaluation but did not predict help-seeking and task strategies. Perceived competence did not predict environment structuring. Perceived relatedness predicted environment structuring, help-seeking, and self-evaluation. This study appears to be the first to examine the predictions of need satisfaction to increase students' capability in regulating their learning.					; Hidayatullah, Achmad/AAC-3526-2021	Csikos, Csaba/0000-0003-3328-5535; Hidayatullah, Achmad/0000-0002-7223-6771													1598-1037	1876-407X				2023 NOV 11	2023										10.1007/s12564-023-09910-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12564-023-09910-9		NOV 2023											WOS:001103013300001

Semantic Relatedness Enhanced Graph Network for aspect category sentiment analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												As a variant problem of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) aims to identify the aspect categories discussed in sentences and predict their sentiment polarities. However, most aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) research focuses on predicting the sentiment polarities of given aspect categories or aspect terms explicitly discussed in sentences. In contrast, aspect categories are often discussed implicitly. Additionally, most of the research does not consider the relations between contextual words and aspect categories. This paper proposes a novel Semantic Relatedness-enhanced Graph Network (SRGN) model which integrates the semantic relatedness information through an Edge-gated Graph Convolutional Network (EGCN). We introduce an ontology-based approach and a distributional approach to calculate the semantic relatedness values between contextual words and aspect categories. EGCN with the capability to aggregate multi-channel edge features, is then applied to model the semantic relatedness values in a graphical structure. We also employ an aspect-context attention module to generate aspect-specific representations. The proposed SRGN is evaluated on five datasets constructed based on SemEval 2015, SemEval 2016 and MAMC-ACSA datasets. Experimental results indicate that our proposed model outperforms the baseline models in both accuracy and F1 score.

J	Lyubimov, IL				Lyubimov, Ivan L.			Services Export in Developing Economies	EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA												This paper examines the structure of services exports in less developed economies. In more developed countries, complex services, such as maintenance and repair or information and communication technologies (ICT), and simple services, such as international tourism, both play an important role. However, in less developed economies, less complex sectors prevail. In the case of the latter, the sectoral structure is associated with a number of disadvantages. First, these sectors are predominantly exported on a regional rather than global scale, and second, as the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic shows, they are sensitive to particular global shocks. This does not imply that developing economies should invest less in these services, as the structure of production factors limits their ability to form viable alternatives. However, developing countries could pay more attention to those service industries that, on the one hand, do not require building a wide variety of complex and costly production ingredients such as innovation systems or large-scale production facilities and, on the other hand, provide more opportunities to export globally, create more high-quality jobs and are more resilient to global shocks. The ICT sector is used as an example of such an industry. This is not to suggest that the ICT sector can become a driving force of prosperity in the developing world; its effect is likely to be modest. Nevertheless, due to the specificities of the ICT sector, it might deliver many more success stories than a typical industrialization strategy.

At the same time, query logs from LOD datasets hold information about which facts are typically queried in conjunction, and should thus provide a notion of intra-fact relatedness. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis how query logs can be used to improve the display of information from DBpedia, by grouping presumably related facts together. The basic assumption is that properties which frequently co-occur in SPARQL queries are highly semantically related, so that co-occurence in query logs can be used for visual grouping of statements in a Linked Data browser. A user study, however, shows that the grouped display is not significantly better than simple baselines, such as the alphabetical ordering used by the standard DBpedia Linked Data interface. A deeper analysis shows that the basic assumption can be proven wrong, i.e., co-occurrence in query logs is actually not a good proxy for semantic relatedness of statements.

This study is designed to investigate whether the mutual influence of autonomy satisfaction and relatedness satisfaction on positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), and aggressive feelings is best described as compensatory. The results of two laboratory studies verify a compensatory relationship and confirm a mediation by meaningful existence. The results verify the compensation effects of high relatedness satisfaction on NA and aggressive feelings when autonomy satisfaction is low. With role-playing and nonrole-playing digital game manipulation, the results are stronger when the participants were being themselves rather than playing a character.					van Dierendonck, Dirk/KIE-8970-2024	chen, chen/0000-0002-9972-3166; Liu, Yuxin/0000-0002-2390-1077; van Dierendonck, Dirk/0000-0002-3545-1798; Jianwei, Zhang/0000-0001-7726-5638													1389-4978	1573-7780				AUG	2021	22	6					2739	2760		10.1007/s10902-020-00338-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10902-020-00338-1		JAN 2021											WOS:000604448700001

The techniques of panel cointegration, long-run FMOLS, DOLS, and Granger causality are used spanning the period 1980-2014. Long-run estimates suggest that, for the top ten renewable energy countries, only renewable energy generation contributes to mitigating CO2 emissions, while the other variables lead to increase emissions levels in the long-run. However, for the case of leading complex economies, the empirics highlighted the significant role of renewable energy in carbon mitigation. Exports quality leads to decrease emissions level and real GDP, non-renewable energy and urbanization contribute to the rise in emissions. Interestingly, for the top ten renewable energy countries, Granger causality analysis mentioned a two-ways short-run relationship between renewable energy generation and export quality and one-way causality from export quality to CO2 emissions. The findings mention that adopting clean technologies using renewable energy might act as a key tool for export quality improvement and mitigation of CO2 emissions. Results are related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-7: using more renewable, affordable energy; SDG-8: sustainable economic growth and decent employment for all, SDG13: regulating emissions and promoting renewable energy) and discussed in this sense.

J	Corradini, C				Corradini, Carlo			Location determinants of green technological entry: evidence from European regions	SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS												In this paper, we explore the spatial distribution and the location determinants of new green technology-based firms across European regions. Integrating insights from evolutionary economic geography and the literature on knowledge spillovers, we study the importance of new knowledge creation and the conditioning role played by regional technological relatedness in fostering combinatorial opportunities underlying the process of green technological entry. The analysis is based on a dataset covering over 900 NUTS3 regions for 15 European countries obtained merging economic data from ESPON-Eurostat and patent information from the PATSTAT-CRIOS database for the period 1996-2006. Our results show that the geographical distribution of green technological entry across European regions is not evenly distributed, offering evidence of spatial path dependence. In line with this, we find evidence of a significant role played by the characteristics of the regional innovation system. New green innovators are more likely to develop in regions defined by higher levels of technological activity underlying knowledge spillovers and more dynamism in technological entry. Moreover, our findings point to an inverted-U relationship between regional technological relatedness and green technological entry. Regions whose innovation activity is defined by cognitive proximity to environmental technologies support interactive learning and knowledge spillovers underlying entrepreneurship in this specific area. However, too much relatedness may cause technological lock-ins and reduce the set of combinatorial opportunities.

The empirical studies in EEG however have not paid sufficient attention to the importance of global linkages nor the role of regional institutions in driving industrial dynamics. Based on firm level data of four-digit manufacturing industries during 1998 to 2008 in China, we find that Chinese regions branch into new industries technologically related to the existing industrial portfolio and related industries are less likely to exit. Further analysis reveals that global linkages, economic liberalization and state involvement not only create favourable conditions to allow a larger role of technological relatedness but also generate opportunities for Chinese regions to create new paths of industrial development.																			1056-8190	1435-5957				JUN	2018	97	2					173	+		10.1111/pirs.12246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pirs.12246													WOS:000434979700001

By analyzing a sample of 119 Spanish firms we find empirical evidence that having experience in risky environments is a useful resource for multinational enterprises. The results obtained show that experience managing high levels of political risk in the foreign direct investment (FDI) portfolio increases the number of countries where the firm may potentially invest. This multinational flexibility encourages a higher degree of product diversification relatedness by facilitating the achievement of economies of scope in the activities carried out in foreign markets. By contrast, the degree of relatedness in product diversification did not show any significant impact on political risk, due to the existence of instruments available to cover or minimize this risk when investing abroad.

Despite the obvious development of their receptive vocabulary size, the subjects at the four learning stages have not achieved the lexical semantic autonomy, confirming the view that L1 semantic involvement in L2 word processing is a long and constant state of L2 lexical development. Explicit vocabulary teaching complemented by data-driven learning can be adopted to trigger the semantic restructuring, overcome semantic fossilization, and promote the development of lexical semantic autonomy in L2 vocabulary acquisition.																			2192-9505	2192-9513				JUN	2014	37	2					231	243		10.1515/cjal-2014-0015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cjal-2014-0015													WOS:000217433700007

It reflects on characteristic distinctions between these regions' portfolios of technological activity as well as the local matches between scientific, technological and economic efforts within them. Building on both theoretical and country specific literature, it suggests that, in China, the internal structure of technological activities might play a lesser role for economic development than in established market economies while their external embeddedness could be more important. Based on a comprehensive dataset, it identifies characteristic profiles and pathways of development among China's provinces. With a view to those, its findings suggest a continued relevance of existing legacies but, equally, newly emerging industrial dynamism. While related variety is now present in many leading regions, the local match between technological and economic activities remains the most relevant discriminator between already well-developed provinces and those catching up with the leading group.

The Role of Relatedness and Unrelatedness for the Geography of Technological Breakthroughs in Europe	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												This article proposes a framework to study how the existing knowledge portfolio of regional economies affects the emergence and occurrence of breakthrough technologies. The study discusses the relevance of cognitive distance between the technology of a breakthrough invention and the existing technological base in their geographic vicinity. Theoretically, it introduces the idea that both relatedness and unrelatedness between the technologies in breakthrough inventions and the regional portfolio of technologies can positively influence the appearance of these breakthroughs, but especially relatedness. Empirically, it investigates a sample of 277 NUTS2 regions in Europe in the period 1981 to 2010 and reveals that, by far, most combinations breakthrough inventions make are between related technologies: almost no breakthrough patent combines unrelated technologies only. Regressions show that the occurrence of breakthrough patents in a technology in a region is positively affected by the local stock of technologies that are related to such technology, but such an effect for the local stock of unrelated technologies is not found. However, the region's ability to enter new breakthrough inventions in a technology relies on the combination of knowledge that is both related and unrelated to such technology.

Even though there is an increasing importance of SMPs for fostering SMEs daily activities, a general lack in terms of literature has been recognized. Innovation in service sector is characterized by distinguished features and literature on product innovation cannot be applied verbatim. Several studies have recognized the importance of Market Orientation to support product innovation, while less attention has been paid on the service industry. Moreover previous studies seem to consider product innovation as a general construct without considering the impact of the relatedness. Applying the Person-Environment theory (PE), this study analyzes the impact of Market Orientation (MO) on New Service Development (NSD), distinguishing new services according to their relatedness to already provided ones. A logistic regression on a sample of 960 full filled questionnaires has been used. Results show that Market Orientation has a significant different impact between related and unrelated diversification. The study aims to contribute to existing literature helping a better understanding of diversification activities in SMPs. At the same time the study wants to offer empirical evidence that could lead to recognize best practices in NSD.																			2048-8882		978-1-909507-93-7				2014							173	180																WOS:000340508600023

Exploiting label semantic relatedness for unsupervised image annotation with large free vocabularies	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS												Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) is the task of assigning keywords to images, with the aim to describe their visual content. Recently, an unsupervised approach has been used to tackle this task. Unsupervised AIA (UAIA) methods use reference collections that consist of the textual documents containing images. The aim of the UAIA methods is to extract words from the reference collection to be assigned to images. In this regard, by using an unsupervised approach it is possible to include large vocabularies because any word could be extracted from the reference collection. However, having a greater diversity of words for labeling entails to deal with a larger number of wrong annotations, due to the increasing difficulty for assigning a correct relevance to the labels. With this problem in mind, this paper presents a general strategy for UAIA methods that reranks assigned labels. The proposed method exploits the semantic-relatedness information among labels in order to assign them an appropriate relevance for describing images. Experimental results in different benchmark datasets show the flexibility of our method to deal with assignments from free-vocabularies, and its effectiveness to improve the initial annotation performance for different UAIA methods. Moreover, we found that (1) when considering the semantic-relatedness information among the assigned labels, the initial ranking provided by a UAIA method is improved in most of the cases; and (2) the robustness of the proposed method to be applied on different UAIA methods, will allow extending capabilities of state-of-the-art UAIA methods.

It is further argued that firms that manufacture products with dense connections to regional industrial structure benefit the most from local knowledge spillovers and thus should grow faster. Based on a firm-level dataset on China's manufacturing industry over the 1998-2008 period, our results indicate that the density of links between a firm's products and local industrial structure does yield firm performance enhancing spillovers. We further decompose the overall density indicator and point out the lack of connections between firms of different ownership types in terms of information exchange and technological diffusion. Finally, empirical results confirm that regional institutions play a critical role in the spillover diffusion between firms of different ownership structures.

Fostering connectedness to nature in higher education	ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH												Environmental thinkers and educators have argued for the importance of celebrating our connectedness to nature, or the perception of being part of, rather than separate from, the natural world. Using pre-and post-test measurements of Nature Relatedness and supplemental interviews, this study addresses the question of whether a particular introductory collegelevel ecology course can increase learners' connectedness to nature, both independently and in comparison to a similar course. The results show that the course significantly increased participants' connectedness, particularly their identification with nature and nature-focused worldview. Other environmental courses studied demonstrated no such changes, suggesting that environmental education does not automatically lead to connectedness. However, if woven into the goals and approach of teaching, connectedness to nature can indeed be fostered in higher education. This is a promising result for educators and others working towards a sustainable future.																			1350-4622	1469-5871					2018	24	2					230	244		10.1080/13504622.2016.1225674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504622.2016.1225674													WOS:000430452600005
J	Abay, M; Akgüngör, S				Abay, Mert; Akgungor, Sedef			Technological paths and smart specialization: analysis of regional entry and exit in Turkey	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE												Smart specialization (SS) strategy emerged as a policy framework within the European Union's (EU) regional policies, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis. Although a wide range of literature on smart specialization exists, there is limited empirical evidence on how the SS framework correlates with regional entrance and exit of technologies. Moreover, little is known about the connection between SS variables and technological growth paths, particularly in the context of a developing country. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between two building blocks of SS (relatedness and complexity) on technological trajectories in a developing country. Using regional patent data for Turkey's regions at the NUTS3 level between 1978 and 2017, the study investigated patterns of regional trajectories by exploring how entry and exit are correlated within the SS framework. GDP per capita, population, the number of universities and techno-parks, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, and complexity of regions were included in the study as control variables. The results showed that technological complexity is negatively correlated with the probability of entry, and positively correlated with the probability of exit. The results also revealed the role of technological relatedness as a tool to attract new and complementary technologies to a region. However, correlations between relatedness and probability of entry are weakened as the number of universities and techno-parks increases in a region, while the correlations between complexity and exit are enhanced, particularly with the presence of universities.

Theoretically, we construct an original conceptual framework encompassing different potential trajectories of regional diversification based on the presence of MNEs. Empirically, we focus on the case of 279 Chinese prefectures over 1998-2007 and our results suggest that the presence of MNEs is associated with industry entry in unrelated and complex industries, supporting the idea that regional external linkages can activate processes of diversification that modify the technological and industrial portfolio of local economies.

Design/methodology/approach The tests of the hypotheses rely on three-wave, time-lagged data collected among employees in Pakistan. Findings A critical reason that emotion-based fights stimulate people to conceal valuable knowledge from their coworkers is that these employees believe their needs for belongingness or relatedness are not being met. This mediating role of relatedness need frustration is particularly salient among employees who are self-centered and see others as rivals, with no right to fight with or give them a hard time. Practical implications The findings indicate how organizations might mitigate the risk that negative relationship dynamics among their employees escalate into dysfunctional knowledge hiding behavior. They should work to hire and retain employees who are benevolent and encourage them to see colleagues as allies instead of rivals. Originality/value This research unpacks the link between interpersonal conflict and knowledge hiding by explicating the unexplored roles of two critical factors (relatedness need frustration and narcissistic rivalry) in this relationship.

The European Union has recently implemented a framework program, the smart specialization strategy, meant to forge the capacity of regions to lever on their already existing specializations to diversify into new technological pathways. This framework program has been strongly influenced by the dominant perspective in the literature of evolutionary economic geography that mainly emphasizes the role of technological relatedness and knowledge complexity. However, some scholars express their concern about the capacity of smart specialization strategy to promote radical and breakthrough innovation. Not to mention that very few regional studies discuss exaptation as a form of boundary breakthrough innovation unfolding the technological silent link between two separated technological evolutionary pathways. From this perspective, since exaptation might play a role as a complementary source of smart specialization, our contribution is to explore the impact of technological relatedness and knowledge complexity on the capacity of regions to spawn exaptive opportunities. In so doing, we reveal that, on the one hand, this capacity can be slowed down by a strategically predefined development process focusing on existing technologically related linkages; and on the other hand, extending the knowledge complexity of regional portfolio can positively balance the negative effect of technological relatedness in the long-run.

Beneficence and the three psychological needs of self-determination theory-autonomy, competence, and relatedness-have all been individually studied as antecedents of meaningfulness. Yet, no previous research has examined them neither longitudinally nor simultaneously as predictors of meaning over time. In a three-wave longitudinal study in Chile (n: T1 = 1477, T2 = 820, T3 = 487) we examined the reciprocal relations between autonomy, competence, relatedness, beneficence, and meaning, using cross-lagged panel analysis. Taken individually, each of the four factors predicted meaning, and when entered simultaneously into the same model, competence, relatedness, and beneficence predicted meaning over time. Furthermore, we found that meaning predicted all four factors over time. Our results thus advance research on meaning in life by examining key predictors of it and showing that meaning itself predicts the same factors dynamically over time.					; Martela, Frank/I-2559-2012	Gomez Mella, Marcos Esteban/0000-0002-0795-9244; Martela, Frank/0000-0001-8664-551X													1389-4978	1573-7780				MAR	2024	25	3							29	10.1007/s10902-024-00741-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10902-024-00741-y													WOS:001169044700001

Farmers have cabbage farming motivation even though cabbage prices tend to fall and are not stable. This research aimed to describe the motivation of farmers in cabbage farming and to describe the relationship between influencing factors with a motivation of farmers in cabbage farming. This research was designed with descriptive analysis method. Central Java was chosen as the research location because it has a high cabbage production and is a recommended area for cabbage exports. The data analysis techniques were descriptive analysis and Rank Spearman Correlation. The result of the analysis showed that the motivation of farmers in cabbage farming is at the moderate level. Farmers have the need for existence at a moderate level, the need for relatedness at the highest level, and the need for growth at a low level. Age, formal education, training, counseling, farming experience, income and availability of capital have a significant relationship with the motivation of farmers in cabbage farming. It is necessary to provide special training and counseling to young farmers to increase the motivation of cabbage farmers.

In this paper, I extend the current research framework investigating the role that specific technological and relational attributes may play on the relevance of such collaborations. Specifically, I focus on the effects exerted by three relevant factors, namely technological relatedness, prior collaboration ties, and geographical distance, on university-industry joint innovation value. I develop testable hypotheses about their impact on the innovative performance of R&D university-industry collaborations, and test them on a sample of 796 university-industry joint patents, developed by 33 universities located in 12 different European countries. Our results suggest that partners' technological relatedness has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation value. In addition, prior ties and geographical distance between universities and firms are both positively related to the achievement of higher innovative outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing bilateral migrant stocks of the 15 main destination countries and 85 sending countries for the year 2000, we find that migrant selection and genetic distance follow a nonlinearJ-shaped pattern: at low levels of genetic distance, increases in genetic distance reduce the positive selection of migration. However, at higher levels of genetic distance, this pattern is reversed and migration becomes more positively selected. We complement this finding by showing that the net benefits of genetic distance are strongly decreasing for low-skilled migrants with increasing genetic distance, while high-skilled migrants are less responsive to genetic distance in general. Results are robust to conditioning on bilateral control variables, including various destination- and sending-country-specific fixed effects and applying an instrumental-variables approach that exploits exogenous variation in genetic distances in the year 1500.

We build on the economic geography literature that advises policy makers to target related and complex economic domains, and assess the extent to which regions actually do this. The article draws on data from the smart specialization strategies of 128 NUTS-2 regions across Europe. While regions are more likely to select complex economic domains related to their current economic domain portfolio, complexity and relatedness figure independently, rather than in combination, in choosing priorities. We also find that regions in the same country tend to select the same priorities, contrary to the idea of a division of labor across regions that smart specialization implies. Overall, these findings suggest that smart specialization may be considerably less place based in practice than it is in theory. There is a need to develop better tools to inform regions' priority choices, given the importance of priority selection in smart specialization strategies and regional innovation policy more broadly.

PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE												The objective of this paper is to critically review contemporary insights derived from studies that focus on relatedness. A well-established body of literature has identified three approaches for measuring relatedness, those based on co-occurrence matrices, industrial hierarchy and resource similarity. From these measures, several authors have begun developing relational networks to capture the branching capabilities of products, industries, technologies and skills. Thereafter the present contribution then shifts from analysing 'what is' and begins considering what 'could be'? It argues that the concept of relatedness lies at the heart of deconstructing issues of unrelated diversification and smart specialisation.

Nature deficit and senses: Relationships among childhood nature exposure and adulthood sensory profiles, creativity, and nature relatedness	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Nature deficit poses critical developmental challenges to the future generations. Louv, for example, stated that children needs adequate nature exposure for healthy development of their sense, learning, and creativity. However, it remains unknown whether individuals having various levels of nature access during childhood may develop different sensory processing patterns. The current study reports relationships between retrospective life course measure of childhood nature exposure and sensory profiles in young adulthood. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shanghai, China, with 700 Chinese young adults (18-25 years old) who grew up in diverse geographies across the country. Sensory Profile was measured using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) with four quadrants; creativity using the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), and nature-relatedness using the Nature -Relatedness (NR) scale. Perceived childhood nature exposure was calculated as a cumulative score from up to three childhood home locations, weighted by duration of residency. Ordinary least square (OLS) and structural equation models (SEM) were fitted to examine the direct and indirect relationships. After adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, low childhood nature exposure was associated with low sensory registration. Regarding the relationship between childhood nature exposure and adulthood creativity and nature-relatedness, significant direct paths and indirect paths through low sensory registration were observed. Results suggested that children who had lower levels of nature exposure grew up to exhibit a high tendency to miss subtle sensory stimuli, and this sensory processing pattern in turn is associated with lower levels of affinity to nature and creativity. Notwithstanding the preliminary nature of these findings, this study offers implications for designing child-friendly urban space that facilitates sensory explorations and allows children to acquire the ability to recognize various sensory inputs.

ADVANCES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL	Lecture Notes in Computer Science				33rd European Conference on Information Retrieval	APR 18-21, 2011	Dublin, IRELAND					Why do links work? Link-based ranking algorithms are based on the often implicit assumption that linked documents are semantically related to each other, and that link information is therefore useful for retrieval. Although the benefits of link information are well researched, this underlying assumption on why link evidence works remains untested, and the main aim of this paper is to do exactly that. Specifically, we use Wikipedia because it has a dense link structure in combination with a large category structure, which allows for an independent measurement of the semantic relatedness of linked documents. Our main findings are that: 1) global, query-independent link evidence, is not affected by the semantic nature of the links, and 2) for local, query-dependent link evidence, the effectiveness of links increases as their semantic distance decreases. That is, we directly observe that links between semantically related pages are more effective for ad hoc retrieval than links between unrelated ones. These findings confirm and quantify the underlying assumption of existing link-based methods, which sheds further light on our understanding of the nature of link evidence. Such deeper understanding is instrumental for the development of novel link-based methods.

J	Montresor, S; Quatraro, F				Montresor, Sandro; Quatraro, Francesco			Regional Branching and Key Enabling Technologies: Evidence from European Patent Data	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												This article investigates the role of key enabling technologies (KETs) in regional branching. Taking into account the general purpose properties of these technologies, and referring to recombinant innovation theories, we argue that KETs knowledge could attenuate the effect that regional branching ascribes to technological relatedness, giving regions more scope for their technological diversification strategies. Furthermore, we claim that regions could benefit from this KETs effect, even if they are followers in their development, thanks to interregional spillovers from closer KETs leaders. Combining regional patent and economic data from a thirty-year panel (1980-2010) of twenty-six European countries, we actually find that KETs negatively moderate the role of technological relatedness for regional specialization in new technological fields, captured by a revealed technology advantage index. KETs knowledge also increases the number of new technological specializations. This positive effect more than compensates the previous negative moderation effect, so that the net impact of KETs on regional branching is positive. Supportive evidence is also found for KETs cross-regional spillovers. Overall, the results provide scientific support for the recent European Commission recommendation to plug KETs into the policy toolbox for smart specialization strategies inspired by regional branching.

The empirical research methodology is based on qualitative part (interviews by using questionnaire) and quantitative part (descriptive statistics, correlation, regression model). In the methodology subjective approach (performance perceived by managers) is combined with more objective criteria. The performance of an acquisition is measured by comparing the acquisition's motives with its outcomes. The acquisitions were divided into three types: horizontal, vertical and conglomerate. The result of this research implicates that the so-called strategic and organizational fit between companies involved in M&A play an important role in improving the operational performance of the acquired companies in the post-acquisition period. Successful acquirers not only had a background in detecting below-average or less than full potential performance, but they also had some skills and competencies to improve the performance of an acquired firm.

Recent literature on "regional branching" proposes that new industries emerge in regions where preexisting economic activities are technologically related to the emerging industry. This article provides a more grounded basis for the emerging literature on regional branching by confronting the regional branching thesis with the realities of an emerging industry, namely, the fuel cell industry. The analysis is based on patent data and qualitative interviews conducted in a selection of European NUTS2 (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) regions. The findings can be summarized as follows. First, the analysis reveals that in the case of the emerging fuel cell industry, regional diversification is dominated by firm diversification, which complements previous studies' findings that entrepreneurial spin-offs dominate regional diversification. Second, the study corroborates the assumption that the process of regional branching relies on knowledge generated by nonindustrial actors such as universities and research institutes. Third, the findings suggest that care should be taken in ascribing the underlying logic of regional branching to the principle of technological relatedness alone. The article shows how some regional diversification processes occur in regions where preexisting economic activities are not technologically related to the emerging industry, for instance, when user industries apply new technologies to their product portfolio. The importance of further investigating and disentangling different dimensions of relatedness and their impact on regional branching is stressed.

RENEWABLE ENERGY												This paper explores the impact of an environmental tax on carbon emissions for the G7 nations from 1994 to 2014 and the importance of the major drivers of emissions such as energy use, economic complexity, natural resources rent and economic growth. The study also verifies the Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis for the G7 countries and explores the marginal effects of an environmental tax on traditional energy consumption, natural resources rent and renewable energy consumption. This paper's unique contribution is that it investigates for the first time the moderating role of an environmental tax on renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, natural resources rent and CO2 emissions. The results suggest that environmental taxes effectively reduce emissions for the G7 countries and confirm that the marginal effects of the environmental tax on traditional energy consumption, natural resources rent and renewable energy consumption rise with the level of taxation in a statistically significant way. The findings indicate that strict environmental tax laws will allow businesses to shift production towards cleaner methods. Finally, the paper proposes that redistributing tax revenues to the research and development of sustainable technology programmes would empower the nations to achieve the United Nations' SDG-7 and SDG-13 goals.

J	He, YB; Lin, T; Zhang, S				He, Yubing; Lin, Ting; Zhang, Si			Does complementary technology within an ecosystem affect disruptive innovation? Evidence from Chinese electric vehicle listed firms	TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY												Complementary technologies are argued to be crucial elements for disruptive innovation. This is even truer in the consistent structure of ecosystems surrounding core disruptive innovations, where firms take interdependence as the premise to provide complementary technologies and create value jointly. Existing research at the disruptive innovation-ecosystem intersection spans a wide range of theoretical perspectives. However, it is still inconclusive about what types of complementary technology configurations might be most useful for the firms they collaborate with to create disruptive innovation. In an attempt to address these gaps, we consider diversity, quality, and novelty as distinguishing structural characteristics of complementary technologies. Empirical evidence from the Chinese electric vehicle listed firms from 2010 to 2019 reveals that the diversity, quality, and novelty of complementary technologies within ecosystems all contribute to subsequent disruptive innovation. Furthermore, we find an inverted U-shaped moderating effect of technological relatedness on the relationship between complementary technologies and disruptive innovation. At intermediate levels of technological relatedness, complementary technologies have greater benefits for disruptive innovation but are comparatively weaker when technological relatedness is low or high. Our findings crystallise a nuanced understanding of how firms orchestrate complementary activities within ecosystems in the disruptive innovation process, thus narrowing the gap with the technological frontier.

The purpose of this study was to examine the reciprocal associations between teacher involvement and the satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. A total of 795 students from the 9th to the 11th grade with mean age of 16.16 years (49.8% female) completed questionnaires about satisfaction of three basic psychological needs and perceptions of teachers' interpersonal involvement at three measurement points 5 to 6 months apart during one and a half school year. To address main goal a cross-lagged analysis was performed. Results revealed half-year stability and within-time correlations of the study constructs. Cross-lagged effects highlighted that teacher involvement positively influenced the satisfaction of the need for relatedness, while the inverse effect was not significant. Students' perception of higher teacher involvement leads to higher satisfaction of need for relatedness, however the higher level of relatedness need satisfaction does not make students more inclined to perceive their teachers as more interpersonally involved. Findings suggest that educators play an essential role in the development of students' motivational processes, and sustaining warm and caring teacher-student relationships should be a priority for teachers.

Our model relies on the use of semantic linking systems for forming a graph representation of documents and queries, where nodes represent concepts extracted from documents and edges represent semantic relatedness between concepts. Based on this graph, our model adopts a probabilistic reasoning model for calculating the conditional probability of a query concept given values assigned to document concepts. We present an integration framework for interpolating other retrieval systems with the presented model in this paper. Our empirical experiments on a number of TREC collections show that the semantic retrieval has a synergetic impact on the results obtained through state of the art keyword-based approaches, and the consideration of semantic information obtained from entity linking on queries and documents can complement and enhance the performance of other retrieval models.

Smart specialization policy in the European Union: relatedness, knowledge complexity and regional diversification	REGIONAL STUDIES												The operationalization of smart specialization policy has been rather limited because a coherent set of analytical tools to guide the policy directives remains elusive. We propose a policy framework around the concepts of relatedness and knowledge complexity. We show that diversifying into more complex technologies is attractive but difficult for European Union regions to accomplish. Regions can overcome this diversification dilemma by developing new complex technologies that build on local related capabilities. We use these findings to construct a policy framework for smart specialization that highlights the potential risks and rewards for regions of adopting competing diversification strategies.

We distinguish between hierarchical structured knowledge pools and allow for the moderation role of the absorptive capacity of the examined production entities. We employ a panel dataset from country specific industrial structures of thirteen manufacturing and transportation industries in seventeen EU countries during the pre-crisis 1999-2006 period.

However, most of the existing DDL methods fall into two extreme cases, i. e., they either learn a global dictionary for all classes or train a class-specific dictionary, leading to less discriminative dictionary as the former do not consider correspondence between dictionary atoms and class labels while the latter ignore dictionary relatedness between different classes. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a well-principled DDL method which adaptively builds the relationship between dictionary and class labels. To be specific, we separatively impose a joint sparsity constraint on the coding vectors of each class to learn the class correspondence and relatedness for the dictionary. Experimental results on object classification and face recognition demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform many state-of-the-art DDL methods with more powerful and discriminative dictionary.

Second, we present a Mathematical Optimization model for the visualization problem and a numerical optimization approach. The model represents the words using circles, the time-varying area of which displays the importance of the words in each time period. Word location in the visualization region is guided by three criteria, namely, the accurate representation of semantic relatedness, the spread of the words in the visualization region to improve the quality of the visualization, and the visual stability over the time horizon.

Using international trade data, we explore how alternative linkages relate to the take-off and acceleration of export industries. Concretely, we run a horse-race among alternative Marshallian linkages across sectors: input-output relations, technology and labor. Technology has a predictive power depending on the specification used. We consistently find, however, that export take-offs are more likely to occur in sectors that are upstream to already competitive export industries. Our findings, which are mostly driven by developing economies, are consistent with Albert Hirschman's 60-year-old view that the forces behind upstream linkages fueled the growth of new competitive industries in the developing world.

Thus, the present study aims to investigate the sense of home concerning the concept of "self-determination" concerning its fundamental factors, which comprise three aspects autonomy, competence, and relatedness. For this purpose, a composite-heuristic method was chosen for the study, which included in-depth interviews using a topic list developed through a literature review and the questionnaire surveys. First interviews were conducted with twelve middle-class dwellers of Boroujerd city of Lorestan in Iran to determine the environmental dimensions responding to self-determination. The researchers conducted the questionnaire surveys with ninety-one participants chosen from architecture students at the University of Boroujerd in Iran to examine the hypotheses derived from the data. The research findings show that the self-determination directly explains the variation of home sense through three main aspects: autonomy by 46.7%, competence by 31.6% and relatedness by 30.5%. These aspects referred to self-security and self- expression and show that for developing a sense of home, the home must be so flexible and adaptable that humans can independently behave in their private and public space.

However, the cost of analyzing links may be a problem if the article links to or linked from a lot of articles.

Existing multitask learning methods explore the relatedness among tasks on the basis of the input features and the model parameters. In this paper, we focus on nonparametric multitask learning and propose to measure task relatedness from a novel perspective in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Past works have shown that the objective function for a given task can be approximated using the top eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of a predefined integral operator on an RKHS. In our method, we formulate our objective for multitask learning as a linear combination of two sets of eigenfunctions, common eigenfunctions shared by different tasks and unique eigenfunctions in individual tasks, such that the eigenfunctions for one task can provide additional information on another and help to improve its performance. We present both theoretical and empirical validations of our proposed approach. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our learning algorithm is uniformly argument stable and that the convergence rate of the generalization upper bound can be improved by learning multiple tasks. Experiments on several benchmark multitask learning data sets show that our method yields promising results.

Population Structure and Cryptic Relatedness in Genetic Association Studies	STATISTICAL SCIENCE												We review the problem of confounding in genetic association studies, which arises principally because of population structure and cryptic relatedness. Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple "island" model of population structure. We take a broader approach, which views population structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships among the study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we review methods of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to the problem of population structure, including family-based study designs, genomic control, structured association, regression control, principal components adjustment and linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most explicit use of the kinships among the study subjects, and has an established role in the analysis of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computational developments mean that analyses of human genetic association data are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for association, which protect against population structure and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.

This article examines whether this also applies to emerging radical technologies that create the foundation for new industries. The article develops a new measure for technological relatedness between the knowledge base of a region and that of a radical technology based on patent classes. It demonstrates that emerging fuel cell technology develops where the regional knowledge base is technologically related to that of fuel cells and consequently confirms the evolutionary thesis.

The proposed algorithm clusters the population into different families based on individual kinship, and adaptively chooses suitable individuals for reproduction. The idea is to use the information on the position of the individuals in the search space provided by such clustering schema to enhance the convergence rate of the algorithm, as well as improve its exploration. The proposed algorithm is tested on ten unconstrained benchmark functions proposed for the special session and competition on multi-objective optimizers held at IEEE CEC 2009. The Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) is used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, in comparison with the IGD obtained by state-of-the-art algorithms on the same benchmark.

This explorative study seeks to address this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of a two semesters OLTE course for German teachers in the Norwegian context. The course was developed to address students' innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness within the framework of self-determination theory (SDT). The paper first details the steps taken to meet students' needs, and then evaluates the effectiveness of the programme by analysing the data from students' questionnaires, which were completed after each of the two semesters. The results showed that most students were highly motivated throughout the course, and that their motivation increased over time. Furthermore, most of the students felt that their psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness were met. Thus, we suggest that designing OLTE programmes according to SDT principles can be an effective means of professional training for future language teachers.

J	Degnen, C				Degnen, Cathrine			'Knowing', absence, and presence: the spatial and temporal depth of relations	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE												Through the lens of 'knowing', which is simultaneously an expression in colloquial English and a set of cognate practices, this paper considers the ways in which relations come to have ontological depth which is both spatial and temporal. The significance of knowing people and places in everyday life exceeds a simple 'familiarity with' or 'knowledge of'. Instead, knowing speaks to what it is that is said to matter in the webs of relations which connect (and sometimes disconnect) people and place, connections that accumulate in uneven and unequal ways. The paper thus builds on recent literature in human geography on absence, presence, and postindustrial ruins and weds it with anthropological theory on connectedness, relatedness, and ruination to examine knowing. This cross-fertilisation of disciplinary perspectives permits me to pay critical attention to seemingly incommensurate and yet overlapping webs of relations (relations with people alive and dead, relations with places present and absent, relations with memory, relations with change and the past). Following Navaro-Yashin's recent work in Northern Cyprus, I argue that knowing in regard to absence sheds light on the theoretical bind of object-centred versus subject-centred approaches.

J	Dragojlovic, A				Dragojlovic, Ana			'Playing family': unruly relationality and transnational motherhood	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE												Scholarly literature on interpersonal relationships between tourist women and local men has been largely discussed under the heteronormative framework of love and sexuality. However, the plenitude of ways in which these intimacies manifest themselves requires that we pay attention to the manifold forms of heterosexual relatedness that these intimacies generate. This article considers how intimate liaisons between Western women and Balinese men that commenced as holiday romances in Bali transform into unruly relationality and transnational motherhood. Focusing the analysis on women's narratives, the article explores how subjects engage in the production of sexual, reproductive, social and economic forms of transnational relatedness wherein the mother and child live permanently in the women's country of citizenship while the Balinese father remains in Bali. Rather than aspiring towards a monogamous relationship and cohabitation as heteronormativity prescribes, the article demonstrates how these non-conventional, transnational families perpetually challenge the nuclear family norm, boundaries of normative motherhood and dichotomies of home versus away.

The present study focuses on the perspectives of people who left school without graduating. Through narrative interviewing processes we collected the storied experiences of eleven imprisoned early school leavers in Finland. We triangulated data-driven themes and used as theory the concept of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Of these, relatedness was the most common and a shared topic brought forth by the participants. Experiencing dissatisfaction and frustration as a result of the need for relatedness played a crucial role in the participants' narratives. The dissatisfaction experienced manifested itself in a sense of detachment and alienation from school as a society of peers and adults. The conclusion of this study discusses different kinds of structure that can either support or hinder the need for satisfaction.

J	Ahn, J				Ahn, Jiseon			Understanding the role of perceived satisfaction with autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the CSR context	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM												In previous studies, researchers have determined that the corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities of a company develop a positive attitude. However, empirical research that explains how CSR activities influence the behavioral intention of customers remains lacking. Thus, this study aims to address gaps in the previous literature by examining customers' responses to hotel CSR activities. On the basis of self-determination theory, the different roles of CSR activities (i.e., feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in increasing positive behavioral intention are identified in the hotel industry. Path analysis using SmartPLS software confirms that participants with a high satisfaction level with relatedness tend to develop revisit and word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions toward hotels. Moreover, satisfaction with autonomy is related to increased WOM intention. By contrast, perceived satisfaction with competence is unrelated to revisit or WOM intention. Therefore, although hotel CSR activities can exert a direct effect on brand-related attitude, their effect apparently varies depending on the types of needs satisfaction. The findings of this study verify that the effectiveness of hotel CSR activities can be linked to company performance by meeting different types of needs satisfaction.																			0966-9582	1747-7646				DEC 1	2020	28	12					2027	2043		10.1080/09669582.2020.1788040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2020.1788040		JUN 2020											WOS:000549629300001

In particular, do MNEs stimulate new domestic firms through knowledge spillovers? Here, we look at the impact of MNEs on the entry and exit of domestic industries in Irish regions before, during, and after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Specifically, we are interested in whether the presence of MNEs in a region results in knowledge spillovers and the creation of new domestic industries in related sectors. To quantify how related an industry is to a region's industry basket we propose two cohesion measures, weighted closeness and strategic closeness which capture direct linkages and dense inter-industry links between local industries respectively. We use a dataset of government-supported firms in Ireland (covering 90% of manufacturing and exporting) between 2006 and 2019. We find that domestic industries are both more likely to enter and less likely to leave a region if they are related to so-called 'overlapping' industries containing both domestic and MNE firms. In contrast, we find a negative impact on domestic entry and survival from cohesion to 'exclusive MNE' industries, suggesting that domestic firms are unable to 'leap' and thrive in MNE-proximate industries likely due to a technology or know-how gap. Finally, the type of cohesion matters. During the economic recovery (2015-2019), it is strategic rather than weighted closeness to overlapping industries that is associated with both domestic industry entry and survival.

The present study aims to analyze the relationship between agentic engagement, basic psychological needs, and test anxiety by using structural equation modeling. For this purpose, 289 female students in math-physics and basic sciences were selected as the samples by using multistage cluster sampling. Reeve and Tseng's aspects of students' engagement during learning activity, La Guardia's et al. basic psychological needs, and Ahvaz test anxiety scale were used as data collection tools. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that agentic engagement positively influenced the basic psychological needs such as autonomy, competence, and relatedness while it could negatively affect test anxiety with the mediatory role of basic psychological needs. In conclusion, agentic engagement can be regarded as a critical variable in affecting the basic psychological needs and reducing test anxiety.

It also postulates that with greater the degree to which these three needs are equally satisfied, the quality of motivation is further enhanced. Yet, this premise has remained relatively underexplored. In this correlational study, we surveyed Greek middle-school students (N = 435; 47.1% males; M-age = 13.95; SD = 0.85) and investigated to what extent balanced need satisfaction contributes over and above the need satisfaction in the prediction of quality of motivation in physical education contexts. Path analysis showed that need satisfaction along with balanced need satisfaction were linked with autonomous motivation but not with controlled motivation. The present findings imply that balanced satisfaction of the needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness can be an additional source of optimal motivation and functioning in physical education.

They tend to compare semantic entities in order to estimate their similarity or relatedness. While semantic similarity is applicable to hierarchies or taxonomies, semantic relatedness is adapted to ontologies. In this work, we propose a novel semantic relatedness measure, named Rel(Topic), within topic ontologies for topic labeling purposes. In contrast to traditional measures, which are dependent on textual resources, Rel(Topic) considers semantic properties of entities in ontologies. Thus, correlations of nodes and weights of nodes and edges are assessed. The pertinence of Rel(Topic) is evaluated for topic labeling of old press articles. For this purpose, a topic ontology representing the articles, named Topic-OPA, is derived from open knowledge graphs by applying a SPARQL-based automatic approach. A use-case is presented in the context of the old French newspaper Le Matin. The generated topics are evaluated using a dual evaluation approach with the help of human annotators. Our approach shows an agreement quite close to that shown by humans. The entire approach's reuse is demonstrated for labeling a different context of articles, recent (modern) newspapers.

J	Wallhead, TL; Garn, AC; Vidoni, C				Wallhead, Tristan L.; Garn, Alex C.; Vidoni, Carla			Sport Education and social goals in physical education: relationships with enjoyment, relatedness, and leisure-time physical activity	PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY												Background: Adolescents' decisions to engage in physical activities are influenced by the social aspects of the activity, including opportunity for affiliation, being part of a team, and the social status it offers. A curriculum and instructional model that has been shown to embed the student social system within a positive program of action is Sport Education. Preliminary evidence has suggested that Sport Education challenges social hierarchical groups and promotes more inclusive social goal involvement. Research is required to extend this work and provide a larger-scale empirical analysis of the influence of a Sport Education program on students' social goal involvement in compulsory high-school physical education and examine how these social goals impact important student affective and behavioral outcomes. Purpose: The purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) to explore the social goals of high-school physical education students after experiencing a year of Sport Education and (b) to explore the relationships these social goals had with perceptions of enjoyment and relatedness in physical education as well as participation in leisure-time exercise. Participants and setting: A total of 363 10th-grade students from the American Mid-West who had completed a year-long compulsory high-school physical education program taught using Sport Education participated in this study. Data Collection: All students participated in four 25-lesson seasons of team sports-based activity taught using the Sport Education model. Seasons taught included floor hockey, volleyball, team handball, and basketball. All seasons were taught by the same teacher. On completion of the year-long compulsory program, participants completed a questionnaire that included items pertaining to their social goals, relatedness, enjoyment of physical education, and self-reported participation in extra-curricular physical activities. Findings: Data were initially screened for outliers and distribution assumptions were examined. Internal consistency estimates were calculated for all variables except physical activity because it was a single item indicator. Descriptive statistics showed that students who had completed two full semesters of Sport Education had higher than average scores on all three social goals of affiliation, recognition, and status. Findings from the multiple regression analyses revealed the robust contribution that social recognition and social affiliation goals made to students perceived relatedness and enjoyment of physical education. Social recognition and status goals also significantly positively predicted extra-curricular exercise participation. Conclusions: This study provides evidence to suggest that prolonged exposure to the pedagogical features of Sport Education develops students' social bonds by configuring the physical education environment to promote peer social approval for participatory behaviors within the model. These social bonds strongly predicted students' perceived relatedness to peers and their enjoyment of the Sport Education experience. Importantly, these social connections to peers and social standing developed in Sport Education influenced their decision to participate in extra-curricular exercise behaviors.

Crowdfunding is a prominent contributor to this pandemic's adverse effects. Donations on crowdfunding platforms have received attention; however, repeated donations, especially during COVID-19, need to be studied. This study aims to understand the role of reward-based gamification as a tool for understanding repeated donation behaviour on crowdfunding platforms during COVID-19. The study uses the self-determination theory to propose the conceptual framework and uses cross sectional data from 514 donors using survey based instruments. This study aims to understand the role of social relatedness with donors' intrinsic motivation to make repeated donations. Similarly, it tries to establish the role of social relatedness and engagement with repeated donation behaviour. The study uses reward-based gamification as moderating variables, and the model controls the experience of donating on crowdfunding platforms. The results confirm the relationship between social relatedness impacting a donor's intrinsic motivation and engagement in crowdfunding platform activities leading to repeated donation behaviour. The study further establishes that reward-based gamification moderates the relationship between intrinsic motivation and repeated donation behaviour. The results reveal that the experience of donating impacts the users' repeated donations. The study presents new insights on the role of gamification in inducing repeated donations on crowdfunding platforms during COVID-19.

Yet, research on the relationship between biodiversity and psychological well-being reveals inconsistent and complex results. This body of research is also restricted to a few socio-cultural and environmental contexts and tends to ignore differences in individual characteristics, such as nature relatedness (i.e., emotional affinity to nature) and ecological knowledge, that can influence people's experience of biodiversity. The aim of this interdisciplinary research is to explore the relationships between biodiversity and psychological well-being, and test the moderating effect of nature relatedness and ecological knowledge on these relationships. An ecological survey was conducted in 24 small urban gardens in Israel to measure the richness and abundance of birds, butterflies and plants, as well as land cover characteristics. In parallel, a social survey (close-ended questionnaires) was conducted in-situ to measure psychological well-being, nature relatedness, ecological knowledge, perceived species richness and socio-demographic variables. Psychological well-being measures were mostly associated with the cover of woody species, perceived species richness, and to a lesser extent, with actual species richness and abundance, for all taxa. Nature relatedness moderated these relationships. Respondents with high nature relatedness demonstrated positive well-being-richness relationships, while those with intermediate, or low nature relatedness showed no, or even negative relationships, respectively. Opposite relationships were recorded for bird abundance. Overall, individuals demonstrated poor ecological knowledge and this variable moderated only few relations between well-being measures, perceived butterfly richness and bird abundance. Our results demonstrate that one-size-does-not-fit-all when considering the relationship between psychological well-being and biodiversity, and that affinity to nature is a key moderator for this relationship. Designing urban green spaces that provide inclusive and meaningful nature experiences and foster emotional affinity to nature, is therefore key to aligning ecological and social objectives for sustainable urban planning.

Learning semantic relatedness from term discrimination information	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Formalization and quantification of the intuitive notion of relatedness between terms has long been a major challenge for computing science, and an intriguing problem for other sciences. In this study, we meet the challenge by considering a general notion of relatedness between terms and a given topic. We introduce a formal definition of a relatedness measure based on term discrimination measures. Measurement of discrimination information (MDI) of terms is a fundamental issue for many areas of science. In this study, we focus on MIDI, and present an in-depth investigation into the concept of discrimination information conveyed in it term. Information radius is an information measure relevant to a wide variety of applications and is the basis of this investigation. In particular, we formally interpret discrimination measures in terms of a simple but important property identified by this study, and argue the interpretation is essential for guiding their application. The discrimination measures can then naturally and conveniently be utilized to formalize and quantity the relatedness between terms and a given topic. Sonic key points about the information radius, discrimination measures and relatedness measures are also made. Ail example is given to demonstrate how the relatedness measures can deal with sonic basic concepts of applications in the context of text information retrieval (IR). We summarize important features of, and differences between, the information radius and two other information measures, from a practical perspective. The aim of this study is part of an attempt to establish a theoretical framework, with MIDI at its core, towards effective estimation of semantic relatedness between terms. Due to its generality, our method can be expected to be a useful tool with it wide range of application areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING DURING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN OF DOCTORAL STUDENTS AT A PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION IN SOUTH AFRICA: AN APPLICATION OF SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION												Doing a doctorate can be an experience but it can also be challenging. Doctoral students often experience high levels of stress, pressure, and expectations, which can have a negative impact on their mental health. There is very little research examining the psychological well-being of doctoral students during COVID-19 in the South African context. This study therefore aimed to assess the psychological well-being of doctoral students at a private South African university. A cross-sectional study was conducted with forty-two doctoral students, using a self -completed and validated questionnaire. The data were collected using the QuestionPro online platform. The significant predictor for positive emotion was identified using multiple of linear regression analysis using SPSS version 27.0. Most of the participants agreed highly regarding relatedness, autonomy and competence. Autonomy and competence are significant predictors of positive emotions. This study highlights the importance of perceived competence, autonomy, and positive emotions for the psychological well-being of doctoral students during unplanned and involuntary periods of remote learning. The findings provide insights into approaches that might be employed to enhance the well-being of doctorate students through distant learning, hence minimising the adverse consequences of this particular circumstance.																			1011-3487	1753-5913				MAR	2024	38	1					217	226		10.20853/38-1-6245	http://dx.doi.org/10.20853/38-1-6245													WOS:001182585500004
J	Sondergaard, E; Reventlow, S; Mogensen, HO				Sondergaard, Elisabeth; Reventlow, Susanne; Mogensen, Hanne Overgaard			Episodic Relatedness in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Families Where a Parent has Multiple Diagnoses	QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH												There is a strong association between social relationships and health. In this article, we ask how a view of social relationships played out in time can help to nuance the role of patients' social networks in their healthcare-seeking behavior. We investigate this link by exploring the dynamics of relatedness in socioeconomically vulnerable young families with a multimorbid parent and their extended networks. Data were generated through repeated semi-structured and open-ended interviews and participant observation. The study found that, for much of their lives, participants experienced life as a series of events that happened to them and were out of their control. This way of being-in-the-world was linked to a consistent pattern of intense and then suddenly discontinued relationships. The relevance for health professionals is that there is a growing trend in healthcare systems worldwide to involve relatives and extended networks in a patient's treatment process. Our findings indicate challenges to this approach and recommend that health professionals are aware that for socioeconomically vulnerable patients with multimorbidity, important relationships can change dramatically, quickly, and repeatedly, over short periods of time.

Based on a case study of transmission and digital information technology (H04L patents) in China, we perform a geographically and temporally weighted regression to unveil the local variations in regional technological path-dependency. To explain these variations, we further dissect the extent to which local actors may dislodge regional economy from path-dependent technological regimes, and the extent to which their path-breaking capabilities may diverge geographically. The model reveals that while all cities in China are subject to path-dependency in the development of H04L technology, the effect of technological relatedness is especially pronounced in the southern coastline, where industrial innovation enables a much larger impact of technological relatedness on H04L technological progress. By contrast, the technological path-dependency withers in the vicinity of eastern coastline, particularly in the Jing-Jin-Ji area, Yangtze River Delta and their western hinterlands, where university innovation exerts a relatively higher degree of path-breaking effect on H04L technology. Additionally, local governmental support is also conducive to inducing H04L technological discontinuities for latecomers by dislodging them from path-dependent technological regimes.					wu, wenjie/HKM-3623-2023; Liu, Ye/J-2787-2019	Liu, Ye/0000-0003-2511-5413													0143-6228	1873-7730				NOV	2019	112								102080	10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102080													WOS:000500201100004
J	Sukoco, BM				Sukoco, Badri Munir			The effects of relatedness, number of partners, and learning on equity contributions in joint ventures	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT												Purpose - Equity contributions in joint ventures (JVs) formation are crucial and how firms decide to contribute its equity less has been explored. Based on the equity theory, the purpose of this paper is to argue that the perceived benefits-to-cost (B/C) ratio of their partners determines the level of contribution made by a focal firm. This study then argues that business relatedness, number of partners, and learning orientation in JVs are the determinants. The conditions that explain the moderating effects of business relatedness and number of partners on the likelihood of an equity contribution are also discussed. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 853 high tech industry ventures in USA spanning from 1995 to 2008 are used to test the developed hypotheses. Findings - A firm tends to employ disproportional equity contributions when their business highly related with its partners, which is similar to high number of partners dues to low B/C ratio. On the other hand, exploration JVs leads firms to employ proportional equity contributions. Further, this study shows that exploration learning positively moderates the effect of business relatedness on the likelihood of proportional equity contribution. Originality/value - This study extends the equity theory by integrating the logic of resource-based view and organizational learning into the formation of JVs.

J	Kim, GC; Gurvitch, R				Kim, Gi-cheol; Gurvitch, Rachel			The effect of Sports-based Physical Activity programme on teachers' relatedness, stress and exercise motivation	HEALTH EDUCATION JOURNAL												Background: Teacher wellness affects teaching performance and students' academic achievement; hence, teacher wellness matters and should be a concern to educational researchers and practitioners. There are several teacher wellness approaches, but no one of them specifically focuses on a Sports-based Physical Activity programme. Objective: To evaluate the effects of a Sports-based Physical Activity programme on teachers' relatedness, stress and motivation towards physical activity. Method: Middle school teachers (n = 32) volunteered to participate in the research as programme participants (n = 12) or non-programme participants (n = 20). The Sports-based Physical Activity programme included 7 weeks of training in Catchball, a team sport and a tournament as the culminating event. The study adopted a mixed-methods design: a quasi-experimental design collecting quantitative data from online surveys and a case study design collecting qualitative data from interviews with the programme participants, non-participants and the school principal. Results: Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that the Sports-based Physical Activity programme was effective in relatedness, F(1, 30) = 5.16, p = .031, eta p2 = .147, and in one of the six motivation subscales, external regulation, F(1, 30) = 4.23, p = .048, eta p2 = .124. The qualitative analysis findings supported the programme's contribution to teachers' relationship, stress and exercise motivation. Conclusion: Overall, the programme was effective in promoting teachers' relationships in school, controlling levels of teachers' stress and fostering teachers' motivation towards physical activity. Further studies are required to examine the impact of a Sports-based Physical Activity approach in diverse school contexts and its impact on student learning.

We argue that in such regions, innovation activity, of lower value, can become the seed needed to grow to innovation of international calibre. We provide support by examining both domestic and international patent and trademark activity for Greece's NUTS 3 regions during 2000-2016. We further implement the principle of relatedness and show that regions with related technology (market) capabilities are more likely to exhibit new technology (market) specializations.																			1056-8190	1435-5957				AUG	2023	102	4								10.1111/pirs.12752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pirs.12752		AUG 2023											WOS:001044349300001

Although there is a large body of research on e-learning, little is known about the extent to which innovative and continuous use of e-learning systems can be influenced by students' social and motivational factors especially their relational identity and autotelic experience. This study collected data from 400 higher education students through a survey to explore the role of students' relational identity and autotelic experiences regarding their innovative and continuous use of e-learning systems while considering the mediating role of students' perception of relatedness. Collected data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. The results showed that students' relational identity and autotelic experience significantly influence the innovative and continuous use of e-learning. The results showed that relational identity and autotelic experience positivly associatewith innovative (beta = 0.190, t = 3.544; beta = 0.405, t = 7.973) and continuous use of e-learning (beta = 0.188, t = 3.115; beta = 0.344, t = 7.459) and relatedness plays a moderating role between relational identity and continuous use (beta = 0.194, t = 4.500, p = 0.000). Relatedness weakens the relationship between relational identity and innovative use of e-learning. However, it reinforces the relationship between relational identity and the continuous use of e-learning. It was found that relatedness strengthens the relationship between autotelic experience with innovative and continuous use of e-learning. The results of this study provide evidence of how students' social and motivational factors can influence their approaches to the innovative and continuous use of e-learning systems. We discuss these results and provide agenda for future practical and professional work.

How teacher emotional support motivates students: The mediating roles of perceived peer relatedness, autonomy support, and competence	LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION												Multilevel mediation analyses test whether students' mid-year reports of classroom experiences of autonomy, relatedness with peers, and competence mediate associations between early in the school year emotionally-supportive teacher-student interactions (independently observed) and student-reported academic year changes in mastery motivation and behavioral engagement. When teachers were observed to be more emotionally-supportive in the beginning of the school year, adolescents reported academic year increases in their behavioral engagement and mastery motivation. Mid-year student reports indicated that in emotionally-supportive classrooms, adolescents experienced more developmentally-appropriate opportunities to exercise autonomy in their day-to-day activities and had more positive relationships with their peers. Analyses of the indirect effects of teacher emotional support on students' engagement and motivation indicated significant mediating effects of autonomy and peer relatedness experiences, but not competence beliefs, in this sample of 960 students (ages 11-17) in the classrooms of 68 middle and high school teachers in 12 U.S. schools.

Drawing upon self-determination theory (SDT), we tested a moderated-mediation model using a sample of 217 frontline service employees in two Chinese hotels. By focusing on the envied targets, our research demonstrates that being envied by coworkers negatively influences the targets' service performance and proactive customer service performance (PCSP). Moreover, relatedness need satisfaction mediates the influence of being envied by coworkers on service performance and PCSP. Furthermore, employee interpersonal sensitivity strengthens the direct effect of being envied by coworkers on relatedness need satisfaction, and the indirect effects of being envied by coworkers on service performance and PCSP through relatedness need satisfaction.

This paper reports on interview data collected from four school leaders and 18 teachers who have various roles in Australian schools (four school sites) about their experiences of professional learning to operationalise inclusive schooling. Most of the teachers did not have leadership titles or designated leadership roles but the descriptions of their experience indicated teacher leadership in action. Our research draws on Transformative Leadership Theory and aims to identify how transformative leadership tenets and an additional tenet-Relatedness, are evident in descriptions of experience in professional learning to lead and support inclusive education. Each school site supports a different model of professional learning: Coaching, Collegial Partnership, Community of Practice (CoP), and Independent Learning. The findings were analysed to consider how the model of professional learning impacted on participant's perceptions of influence to operationalise inclusive practices. Our findings indicate that the Transformative Leadership Theory provided a comprehensive framework to elucidate the majority of the findings in this study. Relatedness as an additional tenet was an important consideration for leading transformative change for inclusive education. The majority of participants contributed to a school model of professional learning and fostered an environment, where teachers could expand their knowledge and skills, and work critically and collaboratively with their colleagues, to promote inclusive education practices in their school communities.

J	Pérez, MA				Perez, Maria Alejandra			Volumes, caves, bodies, relatedness: The case of Cuban speleology and national defense	GEOFORUM												Scholarship on voluminous geographies not only takes seriously geopolitics' three-dimensionality, but also the ways bodies experience the diverse materialities and vulnerabilities of volumetric infrastructures on the one hand, and the earth and its dynamic ecosystems, on the other. Focusing on the relational sociality among bodies-or rather, beings-as they explore and map caves, I emphasize the shared quality of how voluminous-and in particular, subterranean-geographies are created, experienced, and represented. The history of collaboration between Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces and Cuban speleologists dedicated to the exploration, study, and conservation of the country's thousands of caves, illustrates the geopolitical implications of this focus. Based on interview and ethnographic data, this paper examines the varied perspectives on the relationship between speleology and defense, beginning with an institutional history, and then shifting to the affective relational qualities of speleological practice, which I argue constitute a shared intimate geopolitics. These relational qualities manifest themselves in forms of relatedness among speleologists and places, some of which structure the organizational (including spatial) features of their practices and their resulting knowledge. Viewed through this lens, cave maps assume an intimate quality as well: as substances that bind, as heirlooms, and as tokens of reciprocity. This perspective challenges approaches to caves as disconnected voids empty of life and sociality. Indeed, caves not only amplify the social, they gather. To speak of caves as only geological phenomena is inaccurate and actually limits scholarly appreciation of their geopolitical transformative potential. In the case of Cuba, this paper makes an important contribution by accounting for intimate encounters with the earth and its representations as key players in geopolitics.																			0016-7185	1872-9398				DEC	2021	127						412	423		10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.06.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.06.025													WOS:000768192800003

It has been identified as a critical technology for developing intelligent systems like Siri, Microsoft Ice, Cortana, and Xiaoai. In 2014, SemEval ranked SR as the top task. While many existing studies have focused on analyzing the entailment of single phrases, advancements in deep learning have made it possible to analyze complete sentences or texts. While the natural parallelism of membrane computing has shown promise for data processing, harnessing this potential to advance semantic relatedness remains an open problem yet to be tackled. This paper proposes a novel Siamese Manhattan LSTM-SNP approach (SiMaLSTM-SNP) for the SR problem. The approach uses a collaborative Word2vec and 10-Layer Attention strategy to represent and extract sentence pairs and a Siamese LSTM-SNP structure to calculate the hidden states of sentences. The multi-head self-attention layer identifies text associations and redistributes hidden state weights. The last hidden state is extracted, and the relatedness score is calculated using the Manhattan distance. The experiments demonstrate that SiMaLSTM-SNP outperforms 17 classical SR baselines and 7 novel approaches on the standard datasets SICK and STS in terms of mean square error performance. This indicates that SiMaLSTM-SNP can accurately capture the semantic distinction between two sentences and effectively preserve their semantic information.

Since value-added exports disentangle global and national value chains, we argue they enable a more accurate and holistic depiction of an economy's capabilities. Specifically, the Industry Space links 51 industries to each other based on the similarity in required capabilities. We emphasize the need for value-added exports by providing evidence that using gross exports significantly changes the similarities between industries. Applying the concept to comparative country case studies, we show that the Industry Space is a useful tool to investigate the economic structure between countries and over time.

SUSTAINABILITY												As society becomes increasingly urbanized, children are becoming much less likely to experience nature. This progressive disengagement from the natural world, often termed the 'extinction of experience', has been viewed both as a key public health issue and one of the most fundamental obstacles to halting global environmental degradation. School education has an important role in mitigating and reversing the ongoing extinction of experience. Here, we examine the role of several factors that determine the implementation intensities of nature-based education by science teachers in the classrooms of both primary and secondary schools. We performed a large-scale questionnaire survey comprising 363 elementary and 259 lower-secondary schoolteachers. Several factors predicted the implementation intensity of nature-based education in schools. The most important predictor was teachers' levels of nature-relatedness, with nature-orientated teachers being more likely to provide nature-based education in their classes. Levels of teachers' ecological knowledge, frequency of childhood nature experiences, and greenness within the school were also positively associated with the implementation intensity of education. Our results suggest that, to promote nature-based education in schools, it is important to increase schoolteachers' nature-relatedness and ecological knowledge, as well as to provide more green spaces within schools.

Skill-specific local agglomeration economies	REGIONAL STUDIES												Do workers benefit from proximity to other workers with similar skill sets? This question dates back at least to Alfred Marshall. We use occupation groups to proxy skill sets and show that the answer likely depends on geographical levels, as well on regional hierarchy. Using longitudinal Swedish data, we document robust evidence consistent with highly localized spillovers at the level of sub-city districts between individuals in similar occupations. We further demonstrate less distance-sensitive benefits of working in districts and regions, characterized by high overall density (of employees in other occupations). We find no evidence of benefits from overall density outside Sweden's three main metropolitan areas.

This paper proposes a Wikipedia two-way link vector model to extend the existing Wikipedia one-way out-link vector model. This vector model contains the weighted out links and weighted in-links of concepts in Wikipedia and uses a TFIDF-based bidirectional weight method to uniformly calculate the strength of the mutual association between a given concept with its out-link or in-link concept. The bidirectional weight is equal to the sum of the weight for the link from the given concept to its link concept and the weight for the link from its link concept to the given concept. Moreover, we also propose a disambiguation strategy based on senses' social awareness that directly sorts the out-links within a disambiguation page in the order in which they occur in the disambiguation page and adopts an adjustable threshold to determine how many senses will be selected. The experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses the existing popular ESA and WCVM methods in the current Wikipedia versions and that our two-way link vector model significantly improves the performance of the existing one-way link vector model.																					978-1-5386-9380-3				2018							323	330		10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00088													WOS:000458742900052
J	Pehrsson, A				Pehrsson, Anders			COMPETITION BARRIERS AND STRATEGY MODERATIONS: IMPACT ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY PERFORMANCE	GLOBAL STRATEGY JOURNAL												The global firm needs to recognize the crucial role of foreign subsidiary strategy in building global competitive advantage and emphasize corporate control of important strategy elements. In particular, there is a need to examine the role of foreign subsidiary strategy in the firm's efforts to break through local barriers to competition that obstructs the search for global competitive advantage. This study seeks answers to two questions. First, how does the business relatedness between a foreign subsidiary and the parent firm moderate the performance impact of local competition barriers? Second, how does the business strategy of a foreign subsidiary moderate the performance impact of local competition barriers? To test contingency hypotheses, the study used data from 191 subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The subsidiaries belong to Swedish manufacturing firms. It was found that greater business relatedness and business scope of the subsidiary weaken the negative impact of competition barriers on subsidiary performance, while product differentiation and customer responsiveness differentiation have no moderating effects. The study contributes to theory on control of foreign subsidiaries by extending the knowledge of strategy drivers of foreign subsidiary performance, and the knowledge facilitates the formulation of effective global strategies.

One of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap among the queries and documents and go beyond keywords matching. To address these issues, in this paper we attempt to use semantic information to improve the performance of clinical IR systems by representing queries in an expressive and meaningful context. To model a query context initially we model and develop query domain ontology. The query domain ontology represents concepts closely related with query concepts. Query context represents concepts extracted from query domain ontology and weighted according to their semantic relatedness to query concept(s). The query context is then exploited in query expansion and patients' records re-ranking for improving clinical retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on the TREC Medical Records dataset. Results show that our proposed approach significantly improves the retrieval performance compare to classic keyword-based IR model.

Industry Relatedness and the Development of New Growth Paths in Regions	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												The question of how new regional growth paths emerge has been raised by many leading economic geographers. From an evolutionary perspective, there are strong reasons to believe that regions are most likely to branch into industries that are technologically related to the preexisting industries in the regions. Using a new indicator of technological relatedness between manufacturing industries, we analyzed the economic evolution of 70 Swedish regions from 1969 to 2002 with detailed plant-level data. Our analyses show that the long-term evolution of the economic landscape in Sweden is subject to strong path dependencies. Industries that were technologically related to the preexisting industries in a region had a higher probability of entering that region than did industries that were technologically unrelated to the region's preexisting industries. These industries had a higher probability of exiting that region. Moreover, the industrial profiles of Swedish regions showed a high degree of technological cohesion. Despite substantial structural change, this cohesion was persistent over time. Our methodology also proved useful when we focused on the economic evolution of one particular region. Our analysis indicates that the Linkoping region increased its industrial cohesion over 30 years because of the entry of industries that were closely related to its regional portfolio and the exit of industries that were technologically peripheral. In summary, we found systematic evidence that the rise and fall of industries is strongly conditioned by industrial relatedness at the regional level.

The study deployed a survey comprising items constituting the proposed model's factors, and measures of satisfaction of basic psychological needs and teacher self-efficacy, which were completed by pre-service teachers (N = 402) in two independent cohorts (n = 185; n = 217). The final model comprised three factors, Relational Dynamics, Student-Centered Organization, and Connected Learning. The findings are evidence of the model's potential utility as a tool for informing the design of learning and teaching, and reflective practices in teacher education.

This mixed study aims to investigate in-service teachers' and learners' perspectives of BPN fulfillment and its issues under the context of blended professional training. A total of 60 in-service teachers and 120 secondary school students from 24 provinces in Indonesia participated in the study. Construct validity of the questionnaire was established using exploratory factor analysis. Findings using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant differences between in-service teachers' and learners' perspectives of the in-service teachers' BPN. Learners believed that the in-service teachers' fulfillment of relatedness and competence was low in connecting to other people using IT, online care, online teachers' adornment, and learning new skills. The interview with both groups of participants depicted that in some points, the learners perceived that their in-service teachers BPN of relatedness made them unsatisfied with low online care, empathy, and massive online tasks. Suggestion to harmonize these issues and their pedagogical implications for the second language (L2) curriculum and teacher training program in Indonesia and similar contexts were discussed.

JOURNAL OF MARKETING EDUCATION												The global pandemic in 2020 caused by Covid-19 required marketing educators to quickly adapt to pandemic pedagogy. It also abruptly curtailed in-person large gatherings, including academic conferences. Although many marketing scholarly professional organizations suffered a negative financial impact, the quick transition to offer completely online live events allowed many marketing educators to attend a virtual conference for the first time. After having experienced the benefits of virtual attendance, will marketing educators return to in-person attendance when it is deemed safe to do so? Marketing educators can earn credit for serving in scholarly professional organization leadership roles and for organizing and participating in academic conferences offered by those organizations. Thus, there is a vested interest in having profitable events to support the organizations. This study seeks to answer the question, what motivates marketing educators to attend in-person and virtual academic conferences? Grounded in self-determination theory, relatedness and competence are examined as marketing educator motivations. Regression analysis of the survey results suggests marketing educators have a relatedness motivation to participate in-person. They also have a competence motivation to participate virtually. Therefore, marketing scholarly professional organizations should consider offering both virtual and in-person academic conferences to address relatedness and competence motivation.

Economies of Scope, Resource Relatedness, andtheDynamics of Corporate Diversification	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Research summary: The dominant view has been that businesses that are more related to each other are more often combined within diversified firms. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with inter-temporal economies of scope, diversified firms are more likely to combine moderately related businesses than the most-related businesses. That effect occurs because strong relatedness reduces redeployment costs and makes firms redeploy all resources to better performing businesses. The strength of that effect depends on inducements for redeployment measured as the current return advantage of one business over another business, volatilities of business returns, and correlation of those returns. This study develops hypotheses for those relationships and suggests empirical operationalizations, encouraging empiricists to retest the implications of relatedness for the dynamics of corporate diversification. Managerial summary: It is believed that diversified firms are more likely to combine more-related businesses because relatedness enables sharing of resources between businesses. Indeed, a firm can apply knowledge created in one business to another business, avoiding costly duplication in knowledge development. Resource sharing also adds value when a firm offers several products, adding the convenience of one-stop shopping and charging higher prices. However, resource sharing is not the only motivation for corporate diversification. In environments where profitability of businesses changes frequently, firms diversify by redeploying part of resources from an underperforming business to a better performing business. This study uses a dynamic model to demonstrate that, with that second motivation for corporate diversification, firms end up combining moderately related businesses rather than the most-related businesses.

In educational practice, its importance is based on interactions as the educational context, in which learning, value formation and meaningful activities take place. The aim of this was to adapt the Interpersonal Behaviours Questionnaire (IBQ) in Sport into Lithuanian and to analyse its reliability and validity. 241 physically active men (mean age 27.01 +/- 7.67) participated in this study. The adapted questionnaire showed good reliability (Cronbach alpha 0.927), content, criterion and structural validity (CFI 0.928, TLI 0.917, RMSEA 0.070, chi(2)/df 2.21) of Lithuanian version of IBQ in sport. The structural validity of the scale showed that supportive behaviours are strongly related to autonomy, competence and relatedness needs (rs ranged from .843 to .877), while supportive and thwarting behaviours have a moderate inverse relationship. However, supportive and thwarting behaviours are not diametrically opposed (r = -.597). Thus, the study shows that the IBQ in sport is valuable for analysing interpersonal relationships explaining the links between supportive and thwarting behaviour. The IBQ in sport can be a valuable tool for advancing research, enriching and improving educational practice in this field.

Using the attentionbased view within an agency framework, we explore the moderating roles of media coverage and industrial chain relatedness in attention mechanisms, and whether such moderating effects differ in digital and non-digital firms. Using a dataset of 2726 Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2021, we find that ESG activism by institutional investors enhances corporate green innovation, and media coverage strengthens this positive linkage. The positive moderating role of media coverage is more impactful in digital firms than in non-digital firms. An unexpected finding is that industrial chain relatedness negatively moderates the influence of ESG activism on green innovation, but this negative moderation is alleviated in digital firms. These findings provide novel implications for firms as they address agency conflicts through shareholder activism and advance green innovation in the digital era.

The assumption behind this sea change-an assumption that is central to the approaches taken in hundreds of research projects-is that crowdsourced markets can accurately replicate the judgments of the general population for knowledge-oriented tasks. Focusing on the important domain of semantic relatedness algorithms and leveraging Clark's theory of common ground as a framework, we demonstrate that this assumption can be highly problematic. Using 7,921 semantic relatedness judgements from 72 scholars and 39 crowdworkers, we show that crowdworkers on Mechanical Turk produce significantly different semantic relatedness gold standard judgements than people from other communities. We also show that algorithms that perform well against Mechanical Turk gold standard datasets do significantly worse when evaluated against other communities' gold standards. Our results call into question the broad use of Mechanical Turk for the development of gold standard datasets and demonstrate the importance of understanding these datasets from a human-centered point-of-view. More generally, our findings problematize the notion that a universal gold standard dataset exists for all knowledge tasks.																					978-1-4503-2922-4				2015							826	838		10.1145/2675133.2675285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675285													WOS:000371990400069

We propose a genetic algorithm, improved by local search techniques, to maximise the overall semantic similarity or relatedness of a given text. Local search is used because of the inefficiency of population-based algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithm) in exploiting the search space. Firstly, the proposed method assigns all potential senses for each word using a WordNet sense inventory. Then, the improved genetic algorithm is applied to determine a coherent set of senses that carries maximum similarity or relatedness score based on information content and gloss overlap methods, namely extended Lesk algorithm and Jiang and Conrath (jcn). The obtained results outperformed other unsupervised methods, which are related to the proposed method, when tested on the same benchmark dataset.

Unlike the traditional literature concerned with selected macro-patterns of the European convergence process, this paper presents a comparative study of two economies, attempting to comprehend more nuanced aspects and underlying mechanisms shaping their evolution. It examines the evolutionary dynamics of the structure and spatial organization of the Czech and Austrian economies since the late 1980s. Therefore, as a basis for subsequent analysis, the conceptual part attempts to systematize the key specific factors of the former command economies. The empirical results show that, despite significant similarities in the structure of these economies, the absolute and relative productivity as well as the spatial relatedness of the main types of industries reveal important differences between these two countries. These distinctions tend to be disregarded when making inferences about the European convergence process on the basis of traditional literature concerned predominantly with macro-patterns. Consequently, this study shows that since the collapse of socialism, Czechia has been reintegrated into the global economy in a different way from Austria, implying different evolutionary trajectories in the future.

J	Boschma, R; Capone, G				Boschma, Ron; Capone, Gianluca			Institutions and diversification: Related versus unrelated diversification in a varieties of capitalism framework	RESEARCH POLICY												The varieties of capitalism literature has drawn little attention to industrial renewal and diversification, while the related diversification literature has neglected the institutional dimension of industrial change. Bringing together both literatures, the paper proposes that institutions have an impact on the direction of the diversification process, in particular on whether countries gain a comparative advantage in new sectors that are close or far from what is already part of their existing industrial structure. We investigate the diversification process in 23 developed countries by means of detailed product trade data in the period 1995-2010. Our results show that relatedness is a stronger driver of diversification into new products in coordinated market economies, while liberal market economies show a higher probability to move in more unrelated industries: their overarching institutional framework gives countries more freedom to make a jump in their industrial evolution. In particular, we found that the role of relatedness as driver of diversification into new sectors is stronger in the presence of institutions that focus more on 'non-market' coordination in the domains of labor relations, corporate governance relations, product market relations, and inter-firm relations.

J	Hu, H; Chen, LY; Zheng, YX				Hu, Hong; Chen, Liying; Zheng, Yuxiang			More vocal when satisfied: the effect of need satisfaction on employees&apos; voice to coworkers	JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY												PurposeThis study aimed to explore the effects of the satisfaction of employees' need for autonomy, relatedness and competence on their voice behavior through the mediation of self-efficacy for voice and perceived risk for voice.Design/methodology/approachThe theoretical model is tested using survey data collected from 209 employees of information technology (IT) firms located in five major cities in China.FindingsThe study found that satisfaction of employees' need for autonomy, relatedness and competence facilitated their self-efficacy for voice and inhibited perceived risk for voice. Self-efficacy for voice was positively related to voice, whereas perceived risk for voice was negatively related to it. Perceived risk for voice hampered self-efficacy for voice.Practical implicationsThe findings indicate that organizations can boost employees' voice behavior by making them feel that they have autonomy in their work, by helping them maintain good relationships with others in the workplace and by enabling their competence in accomplishing their job.Originality/valueThis study highlights that satisfying employees' psychological needs plays a pivotal role in facilitating their voice behavior. The authors provide new insights into the relationship between need satisfaction and voice behavior and into the mediating roles of self-efficacy for voice and perceived risk for voice.

Despite an extensive amount of work dedicated to this area of research, the understanding of their foundation is still limited in real-world applications. In this paper, a unifying approach representing topic-based models is proposed and from which the state-of-the-art semantic relatedness measures are divided into two distinct types of topic-based and ontology-based models. Regardless of extensive researches in the field of ontology-based models, topic-based models have not been taken into account considerably. Consequently, the unified approach is able to highlight equivalences among these models and propose bridges between their theoretical bases. On the other hand, presenting a comprehensive unifying approach of topic-based models induces readers to have a common understanding of them despite the differences and complexities between their architecture and configuration details. In order to evaluate topic-based models in comparison to ontology-based models, comprehensive experiments in the application of semantic relatedness of geographic phrases have been applied. Empirical results have demonstrated that not only topic-based models in comparison to ontology-based models confront with fewer restrictions in the real world, but also their performance in computing semantic relatedness of geographic phrases is significantly superior to ontology-based models.

J	Breul, M; Pruss, F				Breul, Moritz; Pruss, Fabio			Applying Evolutionary Economic Geography beyond case studies in the Global North: Regional diversification in Vietnam	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY												Hitherto, the path-dependent understanding of regional diversification in Evolutionary Economic Geography (EEG) has drawn largely on insights into industrialized countries. However, in the past few decades several regions in the Global South have undergone rapid structural transformations despite starting out with unfavourable regional asset bases. This raises the question as to whether the strong emphasis on endogenous capabilities in EEG also provides a sound theoretical framework for explaining these tremendous diversification dynamics. This paper therefore aims to re-evaluate the wider validity of the path-dependent conceptualization of regional diversification in the context of a lower-middle income economy. To this end, we analyse the diversification of Vietnamese regions between 2006 and 2015. In order to take into account context-specific conditions that characterize Vietnam's economy, we add the role of foreign-owned firms and state-owned enterprises to the conceptualization of regional diversification processes. While the role of relatedness holds true for Vietnam, the presence of foreign-owned firms allowed Vietnamese regions to break away from path dependency and diversify to unrelated industries. The findings highlight that only by adapting the analysis to context-specific conditions are we able to understand how regional diversification takes place across different settings.

In this article, the experiences of first-year Psychology students are explored through the lenses of the self-determination theory. Both content and thematic analyses were done with 79 students' reflections on the aspects they regarded as facilitating/preventing success in their studies. Responses ranged from complete external control (amotivation and external regulation) to high levels of internal control (integration). While many participants articulated their perceptions of incompetence, other participants took ownership of their behavior and articulated how an interest in and enthusiasm for Psychology as a discipline moved them toward feelings of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. High value was placed on a well-structured but warm and responsive educational context.

For the analysis, we use firm-level information from the Spanish Panel of Technological Innovation (PITEC) and combine these data with information from other sources at the sectoral-regional level, obtaining an unbalanced panel of 28,082 observations of Spanish firms. Our results suggest that knowledge agglomeration affects both the probability of participation in subsidy programs and the subsidy amount awarded to supported firms. This effect is heterogeneous depending on the dimension of knowledge agglomeration considered (technological relatedness, regional specialization, intrasectoral or upstream knowledge pool, technological cooperation) and the level (regional, national, or European) of governance of public agencies.

Genesis and Change in Physical Educators' Use of Social Media for Professional Development and Learning	JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION												Purpose: This descriptive study investigates the genesis and change in physical educators' social media use for professional development and learning. Method: Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 48 physical educators who had actively used various social media professionally for an extended period of time. The data were analyzed inductively and aligned to the basic psychological needs defined by self-determination theory: relatedness, autonomy, and competence. Results: Building relationships with a trusted network of people and opportunities to express their autonomy were important drivers in the participants' genesis and continued use of social media. Developing competence at both the start and throughout their social media journey was also critical. Discussion/Conclusions: The findings provide a starting point for in-depth research on the motivational characteristics underpinning physical educators' reasons for starting and continuing to use social media for professional development and learning, and how these might change over time based on different psychological needs.

J	Keipi, T				Keipi, Teo			Relatedness Online: An Analysis of Youth Narratives Concerning the Effects of Internet Anonymity	YOUNG												This article explores youth narratives concerning the effects of internet anonymity on social ties online. Using an essay-based study of 78 youth (mean age 15.5 years), the effects of internet anonymity on relationships were examined. Results of the qualitative thematic approach showed that anonymity online has led to new forms of relational risk, stemming from misplaced trust or deception. Anonymity was also seen as lessening barriers to relational intimacy, as weak ties could transition to strong ties based on shared interests or social validation. Anonymity was also viewed as enhancing interactive courage and self-expression. Harassment and other negative behaviours were strengthened through anonymity. The dynamics between strong and weak ties were central to risks; here, social tie deception was found to cause harm where an aggressor feigned strong ties in the pursuit of instrumental gain. The findings point to the prominence of the online social effects youth attribute to anonymity.

Method: A 36-session sport education season was implemented within a community program for youths from disadvantaged environments. Three coaches, one researcher, and 31 children aged 9-11 years (17 boys and 14 girls) of diverse ethnicities participated. Qualitative data were obtained through four focus groups conducted during the program in addition to the research diary of the researcher, who played the role of participant observer. Results: The coaches observed a progressive evolution in the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, relatedness, and the need referred to as novelty. Discussion/Conclusion: We may conclude that sport education can be a valuable tool to improve the satisfaction of these needs in children from socially vulnerable backgrounds.

This paper looks at how countries develop different types of renewable energy technology to achieve this transformation. We highlight the place-dependence in the global innovation systems of renewable energy technologies by focusing on how countries benefit from local and global knowledge. We show that both the relatedness of a country's knowledge base, and international knowledge spillovers contribute to the development of renewable energy technologies. For low- and middle- income countries, domestic markets for renewables play a crucial role in absorbing and utilising these international knowledge spillovers. The results provide a better understanding of how countries can acquire new knowledge in renewable energy technologies.

J	Shin, M; Johnson, ZD				Shin, Matt; Johnson, Zac D.			From student-to-student confirmation to students' self-determination: an integrated peer-centered model of self-determination theory in the classroom	COMMUNICATION EDUCATION												In the current study, we applied self-determination theory within a cross-sectional research design to test a latent variable model in order to explore how peer relationships in the classroom might impact students' autonomous motivation. Using a sample of 342 U.S. college students, we investigated how student-to-student confirmation might indirectly influence students' intrinsic motivation to learn through the satisfaction of their basic psychological needs for competence and relatedness. Results of a latent variable model suggest that students who receive confirmation from their classmates experience greater perceptions of competence and relatedness in the classroom. More importantly, through the satisfaction of these needs, student-to-student confirmation appears to have a positive indirect effect on students' intrinsic motivation to learn independent of their satisfaction for autonomy. Findings from our study align with the theoretical assumptions of confirmation and the propositions of self-determination theory. Self-determination theory scholars have long called for the strategic use of needs-supportive instruction to stimulate greater autonomous motivation within students. Perhaps it also behooves instructors to promote conditions and opportunities in which students are more likely to experience confirmation from their fellow classmates and thereby experience more needs-satisfying interactions.

J	Rusu, D; Fortuna, B; Mladenic, D				Rusu, Delia; Fortuna, Blaz; Mladenic, Dunja			Measuring concept similarity in ontologies using weighted concept paths	APPLIED ONTOLOGY												Semantic similarity and relatedness between concepts have been extensively studied in different areas ranging from psychology to computational linguistics. In this paper we address the problem of determining the similarity between concepts defined in a knowledge source such as an ontology. The focus is measuring similarity between concepts from the same ontology. We propose a concept similarity algorithm based on geometric models for representing concepts and relationships, which can be applied to different types of ontologies. The key idea is the concept weighting scheme which allows for quantifying the degree of abstractness of concepts. The evaluation settings involving two ontologies validate and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach. Using the proposed measure, which closely resembles the human judgment of similarity, we can reliably recreate predefined concept clusters, and generate more informative concept paths.

J	Carreira, JM				Carreira, Junko Matsuzaki			Motivational orienations and psychological needs in EFL learning among elementary school students in Japan	SYSTEM												This study examined Japanese elementary school students' motivational orientations for learning English as a foreign language (EFL) and fundamental psychological needs from a self-determination theory perspective, exploring the relations between motivational orientations (e.g., intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, and external regulation) and basic psychological needs (e.g., autonomy, competence, and relatedness). An exploratory factor analysis of the motivational orientations of 505 fifth and sixth grade students of Japanese public elementary schools showed that this is composed by three factors: intrinsic motivation, introjected-and-identified regulation, and external regulation. Results showed a pattern of correlations reflecting a continuum of increasing self-determination from less self-determined forms of motivation to more self-determined forms of motivation. This study also assessed whether different types of basic psychological needs are linked to motivational orientations. Results show that psychological needs are more strongly related to intrinsic motivation than to less self-determined forms of motivation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, research within educational and work contexts is stifled by the lack of an exhaustively validated measure. Following extensive preparatory and pilot work, the present three studies (total N = 762) aimed to develop such a measure and validate it against the Basic Need Satisfaction at Work Scale (Deci et al. in Personal Soc Psychol Bull 27(8):930-942, 2001) and an adapted version of the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (Sheldon and Hilpert in Motivation Emot 36(4):439-451, 2012). The Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale demonstrated a better factor structure and internal reliability than its predecessors, and good criterion validity. This improvement was due to the exclusion of ambiguous items and items measuring antecedents of need satisfaction and frustration. The results also strengthen current evidence showing that need satisfaction and frustration are distinct but related constructs, and each better predicts well-being and psychological health problems, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on cross sectional data from 661 employees who completed validated questionnaires such as the the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) and the basic need satisfaction at work (BNSW). The data were analysed using structural equation modeling in AMOS 18.0. Findings - The results show that both transformational leadership and the transactional behavior management by exception active are significantly related to fulfillment of the basic needs. Significant regression weights of 0.50 (p < 0.01) 0.46 (p < 0.01), and 0.21 (p < 0.01) from transformational leadership to relatedness, autonomy and competence were also found. Negative and smaller paths were revealed from management by exception to relatedness (= -0.12, p < 0.01), competence (= -0.12, p < 0.05), and autonomy (= -0.18, p < 0.01). Squared multiple correlations (R 2) for relatedness, competence and autonomy were 0.28, 0.06, and 0.27, respectively.

J	Danley, T; Eriksson, RH				Danley, Therese; Eriksson, Rikard H.			Co-Worker complementarities and new firm survival	INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION												In the present paper, we analyse the association between the skill composition of young firms and the firms' subsequent survival. This is made possible by means of a matched employer-employee dataset from Statistics Sweden on a cohort of firms that started between 2001 and 2003. Our findings show that, compared to firms that exit, the firms that survive at least until 2012 have teams with higher complementarity at the start, and successively increase their skill complementarity over time. Subsequent discrete time hazard models, controlling for several well-known determinants of firm longevity, show that complementarity plays a crucial role for firm survival. Higher skill synergy within firms, as compared to high degrees of substitutability, is associated with a lower conditional probability of failing. The role of skill complementarity is stable across different specifications and outweighs many other determinants of firm survival, such as starting size and experience of the founder.

J	Vermeulen, M; Castelijns, J; Kools, Q; Koster, B				Vermeulen, Marjan; Castelijns, Jos; Kools, Quinta; Koster, Bob			Measuring student teachers' basic psychological needs	JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR TEACHING												In Self-Determination Theory, basic psychological needs for relatedness, autonomy and competence are distinguished. Basic psychological need-fulfilment is considered to be critical for human development and intrinsic motivation. In the Netherlands, the concept of basic psychological need-fulfilment is introduced in the curricula of many teacher education institutes. This study reports on five teacher education institutes for primary school teachers where study coaches made use of a Dutch version of the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) to collect data to be used in a discussion with student teachers about their intrinsic motivation for a specific part of the teacher education course. On the basis of the outcomes of this discussion, study coaches and student teachers derived consequences for day-to-day practice in their classrooms. The data which resulted were also used to establish whether the theoretical distinction between three basic psychological needs was found in this sample of student teachers in the Netherlands. The results show that the constructs of relatedness, autonomy and competence were found and could be measured using a 14-item five-point scale, based partly on the original BPNS and partly on new items that focus on different sources of perceived need-fulfilment, namely teacher education in general, the study coach and fellow students.

J	Oh, Y; Lee, J				Oh, Yoojin; Lee, Jongkuk			When do firms enter a repeated partnership? The effect of contract terms and relative partner characteristics	MANAGEMENT DECISION												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the mechanisms of partner selection from the transaction cost economics' viewpoint. This paper reveals that a firm's choice to initiate a new alliance with a new partner or form a repeated alliance with an existing partner depends on contract terms and the relative characteristics of partners. Design/methodology/approach - The authors examine 555 alliances in high-tech industries from 2001 to 2009, which the authors collected from secondary sources, including the Securities Data Company Platinum and Compustat databases. The authors use a logit model to reveal the effect of contract terms and relative partner characteristics on repeated partnership. Findings - The results show that repeated partnership is less likely to be combined with equity sharing. Repeated partnership is also negatively associated with the functional scope of a new alliance. Finally, a firm is more likely to enter a repeated partnership when its partner is from a different country. Originality/value - This research provides new insights into how the choice of an alliance partner depends on contract terms and the relative characteristics of partners. Identifying factors associated with partner selection helps us understand the fundamental mechanisms of initiating a new alliance. It allows focal firms to foresee the behavior of their peers or competitors in certain circumstances and thus provides important insights for developing corresponding strategies more effectively.																			0025-1747	1758-6070					2017	55	10					2237	2255		10.1108/MD-08-2016-0570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-08-2016-0570													WOS:000415340700010

A common thread to most genetic investigations is familial relationships. Close relatives can be identified from family records, and more distant relatives can be inferred from large panels of genetic markers. Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be noisy, especially regarding distant relatives. We propose a new method for denoising genetically-inferred relationship matrices by exploiting the underlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals. The approach, which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing, employs a multi-scale decomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise relationships. On both simulated and real data, we show that smoothing leads to better estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals. We illustrate our method with a large genome-wide association study and estimate the "heritability" of body mass index quite accurately. Traditionally heritability, defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable to additive genetic effects, is estimated from samples of closely related individuals using random effects models. We show that by using smoothed relationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based samples. Finally, while our methods have been developed for refining genetic relationship matrices and improving estimates of heritability, they have much broader potential application in statistics. Most notably, for error-in-variables random effects models and settings that require regularization of matrices with block or hierarchical structure.

However, which economic activities within the aerospace industry countries hoping to develop economically should target (if any) is not clear. The recently developed input-output product space (IO-PS) analysis approach (developed for use in the minerals industry) promises to provide guidance in this respect, as it aims to identify strategic commodities that best support capability building in a country. This study thus evaluates the use of this approach to guide industrial policy in developing countries interested in the aerospace industry. In particular, the aerospace value chain is mapped using international trade codes and product space metrics are calculated for each of the identified product categories. This is then followed by a simulation to determine optimal developmental paths in the industry for the case of South Africa. The results from this analysis are compared to the existing policy of the South African government in this industry. This enables case specific recommendations as well as general observations regarding the aerospace industry as a springboard for industrial development.)

J	Chen, M; Kaul, A; Wu, B				Chen, Mo; Kaul, Aseem; Wu, Brian			Adaptation across multiple landscapes: Relatedness, complexity, and the long run effects of coordination in diversified firms	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Research Summary We study the effect of coordination between businesses on the adaptation of diversified firms. Using a simulation-based approach, we show that coordination between businesses limits adaptation, causing the relative performance of diversified firms to decline relative to their focused counterparts over time, with this effect being strongest for moderate levels of relatedness between, and complexity within, businesses. Given complexity, firms diversifying into moderately related businesses may therefore be better off limiting coordination between businesses to a few key activities-if they diversify at all-sacrificing short run synergies for long run flexibility. Our study thus offers a novel argument for conglomerate diversification, while linking work on the costs of coordination in diversified firms to the literature on organizational adaptation. Managerial Summary While coordination of activities between businesses enables a diversified firm to realize synergies, it may also limit the flexibility of each business to adapt to changing conditions over time. Thus, the very cross-business coordination that gives a diversified firm an advantage relative to its single business competitors in the short run may cause it to fall behind them in the long run. Using a mathematical simulation, we show that this negative effect is strongest for firms coordinating across moderately related businesses with activities that are highly interdependent. Multibusiness firms-especially moderately related diversifiers in complex businesses-may thus be better off coordinating only those activities that yield the greatest synergies, foregoing more marginal synergies in the short run for the sake of long run flexibility.

Resource redeployment in corporate acquisitions: Going beyond horizontal acquisitions	LONG RANGE PLANNING												Resource redeployment between merging firms is an important way in which corporate acquisitions create value. Such redeployment can occur in horizontal deals when the acquirer and the target are from the same industry, or in non-horizontal deals when the acquirer and the target come from different industries. Although existing research focuses on the former scenario of resource deployment in horizontal acquisitions, resource deployment as a potential source of value in non-horizontal acquisitions has been understudied. This study uses a formal model to develop a theory of resource redeployment that both embraces and contrasts both types of acquisitions to offer new insights. The study concludes that the focus on horizontal acquisitions misses M&A contexts in which resource redeployment can create the highest value. Results from the model also demonstrate that acquisition performance has an inverse U-shaped relationship with relatedness between the merging firms. Finally, the effect of relatedness critically depends on the asymmetry in returns between the merging firms. These results are important for future empirical studies of acquisition performance and of target selection and are instructive to corporate managers seeking targets and managing potential redeployment of resources across organizations via M&A.																			0024-6301	1873-1872				DEC	2023	56	6							102287	10.1016/j.lrp.2022.102287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2022.102287		NOV 2023											WOS:001128447200001

In this paper, analytic hierarchy process is used as guidance in information security policy decision-making by identifying influencing factors and their weights for information security policy compliance. The weights for intrinsic motivators are identified based on self-determination theory as essential criteria, namely, autonomy, competence, relatedness, along with behavioural intention towards compliance; and use four awareness focus areas. A survey of cyber-security decision-makers at a Fortune 600 organisation provided data. The results suggest that behavioural intention (52% of the weight of influencing factors) is more important than autonomy (21%), competence (21%) or relatedness (6%) in influencing behaviour towards information security policy compliance. Determining weights of intrinsic motivation, intention, and awareness focus areas can help security decision-making and compliance with policy, and support design of effective security awareness programmes. However, these weights may in turn be affected by local organisational and cultural factors.

SUSTAINABILITY												The current study drew from emotional contagion and source credibility theories to investigate whether watching differentially sourced panda videos may influence attitudes toward the "brand" image of China. An experiment (N = 245) conducted with a U.S. college student sample showed that perceived source credibility and nature relatedness were positively linked to emotional response toward the video. A non-governmental video source was perceived to be more credible than a governmental video source in influencing attitude toward Chinese culture, emotional response toward the video, and attitude toward wildlife conservation. The latter two variables and nature relatedness likewise positively predicted attitude toward Chinese culture, which in turn had a positive effect on attitude toward Chinese people; attitude toward Chinese people further positively affected attitude toward Chinese government. These findings suggest that panda diplomacy as a soft-power nation-branding device might have been relatively effective in building goodwill toward Chinese culture, people, and government overtime.

This paper proposes a novel web personalization system that accepts the timing information, semantic information along with the navigational pattern, and classifies the users according their interest and behavior on the site. The proposed model is validated by constructing a Web personalization model using the real and synthetic data and the results are promising.																					978-1-5090-2028-7				2016							1390	1396																WOS:000392503100226

The role of CSR-brand (mis)fit and sense of relatedness	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT												PurposeThis paper aims to explore whether brand corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives increase consumers' happiness via a mediating mechanism of emotional brand attachment and to examine how brand CSR's effect may be moderated by CSR fit (e.g. CSR-brand fit vs misfit) and sense of relatedness (e.g. low vs high). Design/methodology/approachA series of six studies (including the one that is available online), combining field and experimental data, were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships. FindingsResults support the hypothesis that brand CSR initiatives make consumers happy by increasing their attachment to the brand (Studies 1 and 2). This effect is strengthened both directly and indirectly through emotional attachment when brands engage in CSR fit activities (Study 3), but it is weakened when brands engage in CSR misfit activities (Study 4). Furthermore, the effect is more pronounced when brands choose CSR activities that have a high sense of relatedness, and it is eliminated when brands use CSR activities with a low sense of relatedness (Study 5). Finally, the results indicate that when brand CSR programs make consumers happy, they become more likely to purchase, spread positive word of mouth and pay a premium (Study 6). Originality/valueThis research has several major implications for business-to-consumer companies that are unsure about the value of brand CSR initiatives, want to make consumers happy but are unsure which CSR strategies to focus on and/or have decided to launch CSR initiatives but lack guidance on the specific strategies relevant to their desired performance outcomes.

Our study shows that the effect of labour mobility can only be assessed when one accounts for the type of skills that flow into the plant and the degree to which these match the existing skills at the plant level. As expected, we found that the inflow of skills that are related to skills in the plant impacts positively on plant productivity growth, while inflows of skills that are similar to the plant skills have a negative effect. We used a sophisticated indicator of revealed relatedness that measures the degree of skill relatedness between sectors on the basis of the intensity of labour flows between sectors. Intra-regional mobility of skilled labour had a negative effect on plant performance, but the impacts of intra- and inter-regional mobility depended on the type of skills that flow into the plant.

Grounded in self-determination theory, the study examined teachers' beliefs in three basic psychological needs (relatedness, competence and autonomy) and the effect of their teaching experience on these beliefs. Data were obtained from 84 Chinese junior middle school English teachers through a questionnaire. Results suggested that teachers recognized motivational practices for relatedness and competence satisfaction while showing relatively low recognition of a few motivating practices for autonomy satisfaction. Teaching experience was found to have no influence on teachers' conception of needs-related motivational practices. Findings reveal that traditional activities like collective lesson preparations may have a negative influence on teachers' beliefs about motivational practices. They also present the necessity for adjustments on educational regulations, and for modern professional training to help teachers understand students' basic psychological needs, and to encourage new ideas to bolster students' intrinsic motivation for language learning.																			2192-9505	2192-9513				AUG 26	2022	45	3					401	415		10.1515/CJAL-2022-0307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/CJAL-2022-0307													WOS:000842122500007

Whendealing with text input, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) techniques play an important role. WSD techniques typically require well-formed sentences as context to operate, and predefined catalogues of word senses. However, such conditions do not always apply, such as when there is a need to disambiguate keywords from a query, or sets of tags describing anyWeb resource. In this paper, we propose a keyword disambiguation method based on the semantic relatedness between words and ontological terms. Taking advantage of the semantic information captured byword embeddings, our approach maps a set of input keywords to their meanings within a given target ontology. We focus on situations where the available linguistic information is very scarce, hampering natural language based approaches. Experimental results show the feasibility of our approach without previous training for target domains.

Entry-relatedness, which has been previously employed to investigate the technology evolution of regional economies, is advanced by introducing a knowledge gravity model. The entry-potential of a newly acquired regional specialisation has been largely ignored in the relevant literature; surprisingly given the high relevance that is attributed to the recombination potential of new capabilities. In other words, just adding new knowledge domains to a system is not sufficient alone, it really depends on how these fit into the existing system and thus can generate wider economic benefits. Based on an empirical analysis of EU-15 Metro and non-Metro regions from 1981 to 2015, we find that entry-relatedness has a significant negative association with novel inventive activities, while entry-potential has a significant positive association with the development of novel products and processes of economic value. This highlights that regions' capacity to venture into high-potential areas of technological specialization in the knowledge space outperforms purely relatedness driven diversification that is frequently promoted in the relevant literature.

It is the purpose of this paper to develop a conceptual framework on innovation synergy realisation in large M&As, that relates the following components: (1) strategic M&A characteristics; and (2) post-M&A integration mechanisms; to (3) innovation synergy realisation. The research explored how different innovation synergies were achieved in nine large medium-tech and high-tech M&As in the life sciences.

High quality interpersonal interactions are associated with a number of positive student outcomes such as increased motivation, effort, learning, satisfaction, and higher ratings on formal student evaluations of teaching (SETs). This study tested a Self-Determination Theory model in a university setting by measuring the association between professors' reported psychological need satisfaction, teaching motivation, and self-reported supportive interpersonal behaviour styles, exploring how these variables related to SETs. Overall, we found support for the model; all relationships were significant and in the expected direction except that reported autonomy and competence supportive behaviours did not relate to SETs. From this, we can conclude that relatedness support is important to the student experience and that professors who engage in relatedness supportive interpersonal behaviours are also positively evaluated by their students.																			1918-2902						2023	14	1							16	10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2023.1.13768	http://dx.doi.org/10.5206/cjsotlrcacea.2023.1.13768													WOS:001026698000003

Firstly, productivity differences between the source and recipient firms have been found to drive these spillovers; secondly, previous evidence suggests that labor flows from multinational enterprises provide productivity gains for firms; and thirdly, industry relatedness across firms have been found important, because industry-specific skills have an impact on organizational learning and production. In this paper, we aim to disentangle the effects of productivity gap, multinational experience and industry relatedness in a common framework. Hungarian employee-employer linked panel data from 2003-2011 imply that the incoming labor from more productive firms is associated with increasing future productivity. The impact of multinational spillovers cannot be confirmed, once productivity differences between the firms are taken into account. Furthermore, we find that flows from related industries outperform the effect of flows from same and unrelated industries even if we control for the effects of productivity gap and multinational spillovers.

This research explores psychological facilitators underlying academic engagement with business in education-driven activities such as student mobility, curriculum design and delivery. Drawing on a self-determination theory (SDT), it investigates the factors facilitating academic engagement in these activities with a specific focus given on their UBC autonomy, competence and relatedness. Based on an extensive and wide-reaching European survey, this research shows that academic autonomy does not only play an important role in teaching and research, but also in facilitating academic engagement in education driven UBC, with UBC competence and relatedness being highly relevant too. This research contributes to the literature by shedding light on education-driven UBC and by applying SDT framework of need satisfaction in this context.

Using a proprietary data set of 716 trade sales, we analyze return differences between lateral and synergetic trade sales, as well as between horizontal and vertical trade sales. We find that venture capitalists achieve higher returns with lateral rather than synergetic trade sales, and that the difference is greater for deals involving early stage companies characterized by strong information asymmetries. In addition, horizontal trade sales yield higher returns than vertical trade sales; however, in boom phases of the venture capital market, this effect reverses. Finally, we find that experienced venture capitalists are able to overcome disadvantageous situations in trade sales, resulting in comparable returns across all trade sale categories.																			0921-898X	1573-0913				OCT	2014	43	3					621	637		10.1007/s11187-014-9557-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11187-014-9557-5													WOS:000341926400006

Sectoral interactions are crucial and dependent on contextual and technological factors, as well as firm-specific characteristics. This paper examines the determinants of firm diversification towards a new technology and their role in sectoral interactions. We combine concepts from technological innovation systems (TIS), sectoral innovation systems and organization studies to examine the drivers of actors' entry as well as their impact on systems' formation, through the effect on intersectoral relations associated with technological variety and relatedness. The development and demonstration of marine renewable energy technologies (MRET) in Portugal over the past two decades provides the empirical case. A database of 237 companies includes responses from a survey of a large part of the actors involved in MRET and potential entrants. A standard binary logit model estimates the effect of a set of drivers of firms' entry in MRET. Firms are more driven by variety-led factors and technology maturity, than by their technological capacity and sectoral proximity. We derive implications for policy and theory, namely for the conceptualization of inter-sectoral relations in TIS.

A semantic relatedness preserved subset extraction method for language corpora based on pseudo-Boolean optimization	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE												As language corpora have been playing an increasingly important role in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, lots of extremely large corpora are created. However, a larger corpora size not only increases power and accuracy but also brings redundancy. Therefore, researchers began to emphasize the study of appropriate subset extraction methods. Due to the trade-off between data sufficiency and redundancy, a group of interesting and challenging problems are emerged that are studied in this paper: (1) How to make the resulting subset include as much data as possible under some necessary constraints? (2) How to preserve the potential useful semantic relatedness included in the original corpora while reducing the size of the corpora? For these two problems, existing work mainly focuses on the methods to construct particular subsets for special usage. These methods are limited in their focus. In this paper, we try to address the problems listed above. First, considering the cubic and binary semantic relatedness among tokens, we construct a general system model and formulate the mix problem as a cubic pseudo-Boolean optimization problem. Then, by analyzing the characteristics of the objective function, we transfer the problem into the maximum flow problem of a corresponding graph. Third, we propose a new algorithm by introducing discrete Lagrangian iteration method. We prove that the objective function is supermodular, which allows us to use fast minimum cut algorithms in each iteration step to propose another fast algorithm. Finally, we experimentally validate our new algorithms on several randomly created corpora. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration in Mexican teachers: psychometric properties, structure and factor invariance	ESPIRAL-CUADERNOS DEL PROFESORADO												The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties, structure, and factorial invariance regarding gender of the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale adapted to the educational work context. A total of 568 teachers from 74 schools (63% women, 37% men) between 18 and 63 years of age (M-age = 37.37; SD = 10.37) participated. The results revealed adequate goodness-of-fit indexes for the proposed models (two and six factors); the six-factor model presented a better fit to the data. The reliability of the different subscales was adequate and presented evidence of strict factorial invariance with regard to the gender groups. In conclusion, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale is a reliable and valid instrument, based on the theory of self-determination that can be used to measure the degree of satisfaction and frustration of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the educational work context of Mexico.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES												Research on the acquisition behaviour of family firms has produced conflicting theoretical arguments and mixed empirical findings on their propensity to acquire related or unrelated targets. While previous work has mainly focused on firm-level variables, this study examines the environment in which family firms operate and the institutional context where acquisitions take place. Drawing on the mixed gambles logic of the behavioural agency model, we theorize that family firms are more likely than nonfamily firms to undertake related acquisitions when they operate in uncertain environments to avoid losses to the family's current socioemotional wealth. However, family firms are more likely to undertake unrelated acquisitions, when the environment is uncertain but the target operates in a similar and more developed institutional context where prospective financial gains are more predictable. Overall, building on a sample of 1014 international acquisitions, our study offers important contributions to the literature on family firms and acquisitions.

We argue that firms' choices to enter NTDs and their subsequent performance in these domains are not only governed by firm-level factors but also by environmental characteristics. Entry is encouraged by the richness of opportunities for technology development, while technology competition by incumbent firms discourages entry and render entries that do take place less successful. Firms are expected to be positioned heterogeneously to recognize and capitalize on technological opportunities, depending on the presence of a related technology base. We find qualified support for these conjectures in a longitudinal analysis of entry and technological performance in NTDs by 176 R&D intensive firms. While opportunity rich technology environments attract entries by firms even if these NTDs are distal from firms' existing technologies, firms require related technological expertise in order to exploit technological opportunities post-entry.																			0022-2380	1467-6486				DEC	2016	53	8					1257	1291		10.1111/joms.12215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joms.12215													WOS:000387352100001

Who is triggering this process? This work addresses these compelling research questions by investigating the role of migrant inventors in the process of technological diversification. Immigrant inventors can indeed act as carriers of knowledge across borders and influence the direction of technological change. We test these latter propositions by using an original dataset of immigrant inventors in the context of European regions during the period 2003-201. Our findings show that: immigrant inventors generate positive local knowledge spillovers; they help their host regions to develop new technological specialisations; they trigger a process of unrelated diversification. Their contribution comes via two main mechanisms: immigrant inventors use their own personal knowledge (knowledge creation); they import knowledge from their home country to the host region (knowledge transfer). Their impact is maximised when their knowledge is not recombined with the local one (in mixed teams of inventors), but it is reused (in teams made by only migrant inventors). Our work contributes to the existing literature of regional diversification by providing fresh evidence of unrelated diversification for European regions and by identifying important agents of structural change. It also contributes to the literature of migration and innovation by adding fresh evidence on European regions and by unveiling some of the mechanisms of immigrants' knowledge transmission.					; Miguelez, Ernest/A-1254-2017	Morrison, Andrea/0000-0002-1878-6780; Miguelez, Ernest/0000-0002-8224-6842													0892-9912	1573-7047				APR	2023	48	2			SI		669	692		10.1007/s10961-022-09927-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-022-09927-z		MAY 2022											WOS:000795451200001

This progressive disconnection from the natural world is profoundly concerning as it affects human health, wellbeing, attitudes and behaviors towards nature. Increasing the quantity of experiences of nature (EoN) can enhance health and wellbeing benefits, but it remains unclear whether it can also affect environmental attitudes across different countries. Here, we conducted a cross-cultural survey among 741 people from France, Israel and the UK, who either own a dog (and thus prone to go outdoors to walk their dog), a cat, or no pet. This setting was used as a quasi-experiment to explore the relationships between EoN, nature relatedness, environmental knowledge and attitudes. Our results confirmed that dog-owners have a higher quantity of EoN. However, we found that although dog-ownership was associated with people's relatedness to nature, the increased quantity of EoN did not correlate with environmental knowledge or attitudes. Thus, increasing the quantity of EoN may not be sufficient for mitigating the effects of the extinction of experience and consequently a more profound understanding of the quality of EoN and the means to enhance it are needed. This knowledge is crucial to help landscape planners provide accessible and suitably designed green spaces that can foster meaningful interactions with nature, for instance through specific gardening practices or creative design.

Partner expertise negatively moderates the relationship between similarity, complementarity and collaborative performance. Geographical distance positively moderates the relationship between similarity and collaborative performance while negatively moderates that between complementarity and collaborative performance. Collaboration network stickiness partly mediates the relationship between similarity and collaborative performance.Originality/valueThis study expands literature on inter-firm collaboration, especially research on the antecedents of collaborative performance. Moreover, this study not only compensates for lack of empirical analysis in partner selection research, but also utilizes second-hand data to enhance the objectivity of analysis.

J	O'Leary, D; Doran, J; Power, B				O'Leary, Daragh; Doran, Justin; Power, Bernadette			The role of relatedness in firm interrelationships	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES												PurposeThis paper analyses how firm births and deaths are influenced by previous firm births and deaths in related and unrelated sectors. Competition and multiplier effects are used as the theoretical lens for this analysis.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses 2008-2016 Irish business demography data pertaining to 568 NACE 4-digit sectors within 20 NACE 1-digit industries across 34 Irish county and sub-county regions within 8 NUTS3 regions. A three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation is used to analyse the impact of past firm deaths (births) on future firm births (deaths). The effect of relatedness on firm interrelationships is explicitly modelled and captured.FindingsFindings indicate that the multiplier effect operates mostly through related sectors, while the competition effect operates mostly through unrelated sectors.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper's findings show that firm interrelationships are significantly influenced by the degree of relatedness between firms. The raw data used to calculate firm birth and death rates in this analysis are count data. Each new firm is measured the same as another regardless of differing features like size. Some research has shown that smaller firms have a greater propensity to create entrepreneurs (Parker, 2009). Thus, it is possible that the death of differently sized firms may contribute differently to multiplier effects where births induce further births. Future research could seek to examine this.Practical implicationsThese findings have implications for policy initiatives concerned with increasing entrepreneurship. Some express concerns that public investment into entrepreneurship can lead to "crowding out" effects (Cumming and Johan, 2019), meaning that public investment into entrepreneurship could displace or reduce private investment into entrepreneurship (Audretsch and Fiedler, 2023; Zikou et al., 2017). This study's findings indicate that using public investment to increase firm births could increase future firm births in related and unrelated sectors. However, more negative "crowding out" effects may also occur in unrelated sectors, meaning that public investment which stimulates firm births in a certain sector could induce firm deaths and crowd out entrepreneurship in unrelated sectors.Originality/valueThis paper is the first in the literature to explicitly account for the role of relatedness in firm interrelationships.

J	Li, N; Sun, DX; Wang, SP				Li, Nan; Sun, Dongxia; Wang, Suiping			Semantic preview effect of relatedness and plausibility in reading Chinese: evidence from high constraint sentences	READING AND WRITING												In natural reading, the processing of words in fixation is influenced by semantic information obtained through preview (i.e., the semantic preview effect). Previous studies have confirmed that two types of semantic information exhibit the semantic preview effect: semantic association, which is reflected by the semantic relationship between preview words and target words, and semantic integration, which is reflected by the plausibility of preview words in sentences. This study examined whether and how these two types of semantic preview information interact to influence readers' processing of words in the fovea. We referenced high constraint sentences, in which contextual information strongly limits the possible meanings, and the meaning of the target word can be activated before the target word becomes fixated. Thus, the meaning of the target word can be obtained at least as early as when the pretarget word becomes fixated. Therefore, by creating a high constraint context, the reader can obtain the meaning of the upcoming word both through preview and through preactivation within the same preview time window. We tested the preview effect of semantic relatedness when preview words were implausible (Experiment 1) and plausible (Experiment 2). Readers' eye movements were measured. The results showed that the preview effect (shortened fixation duration) of semantic relatedness appeared only when the preview word was plausible. This finding suggests that readers can use semantic information from different sources within the same preview time window and that message-level representations play an immediate and pivotal role in this process.																			0922-4777	1573-0905				MAY	2023	36	5					1319	1338		10.1007/s11145-022-10350-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11145-022-10350-x		AUG 2022											WOS:000844498400001

However, systematic evidence on how firms build global knowledge access is still lacking. In this paper, we analyse how global work connections relate to differences in the skill composition of employees within companies and local industry clusters. We gather survey data from 10% of workers in a local industry in Sweden, and complement this with digital trace data to map co-worker networks and skill composition. This unique combination of data and features allows us to quantify global connections of employees and measure the degree of skill similarity and skill relatedness to co-workers. We find that workers with extensive local networks typically have skills related to those of others in the region and to those of their co-workers. Workers with more global ties typically bring in less related skills to the region. These results provide new insights into the composition of skills within knowledge-intensive firms by connecting the geography of network contacts to the diversity of skills accessible through them.

C	Xu, BW; Shirani, A; Lo, D; Alipour, MA			ACM	Xu, Bowen; Shirani, Amirreza; Lo, David; Alipour, Mohammad Amin			Prediction of Relatedness in Stack Overflow: Deep Learning vs. SVM A Reproducibility Study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND MEASUREMENT (ESEM 2018)					12th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) as part of the Empirical Software Engineering International Week (ESEIW)	OCT 11-12, 2018	Oulu, FINLAND	ACM, IEEE				Background Xu et al. used a deep neural network (DNN) technique to classify the degree of relatedness between two knowledge units (question-answer threads) on Stack Overflow. More recently, extending Xu et al.'s work, Fu and Menzies proposed a simpler classification technique based on a fine-tuned support vector machine (SVM) that achieves similar performance but in a much shorter time. Thus, they suggested that researchers need to compare their sophisticated methods against simpler alternatives. Aim The aim of this work is to replicate the previous studies and further investigate the validity of Fu and Menzies' claim by evaluating the DNN- and SVM-based approaches on a larger dataset. We also compare the effectiveness of these two approaches against SimBow, a lightweight SVM-based method that was previously used for general community question-answering. Method We (1) collect a large dataset containing knowledge units from Stack Overflow, (2) show the value of the new dataset addressing shortcomings of the original one, (3) re-evaluate both the DNN- and SVM-based approaches on the new dataset, and (4) compare the performance of the two approaches against that of SimBow. Results We find that: (1) there are several limitations in the original dataset used in the previous studies, (2) effectiveness of both Xu et al.'s and Fu and Menzies' approaches (as measured using F1-score) drop sharply on the new dataset, (3) similar to the previous finding, performance of SVM-based approaches (Fu and Menzies' approach and SimBow) are slightly better than the DNN-based approach, (4) contrary to the previous findings, Fu and Menzies' approach runs much slower than DNN-based approach on the larger dataset - its runtime grows sharply with increase in dataset size, and (5) SimBow outperforms both Xu et al. and Fu and Menzies' approaches in terms of runtime. Conclusion We conclude that, for this task, simpler approaches based on SVM performs adequately well. We also illustrate the challenges brought by the increased size of the dataset and show the benefit of a lightweight SVM-based approach for this task.

On the basis of qualitative interviews, dialogues and filmed observations of everyday life, we investigate how children and young people in contemporary Denmark engage emotionally in sibling relationships. It emerges that siblingships inevitably involve frictions in various forms. In the article, we analyse the impact frictions have on social relations and discuss how such dynamics in sibling relationships both reflect and influence family constitutions and dynamics.

First, it examines the relationship between technological capabilities and new trademark applications. Second, it considers whether regions branch out to new trademark specializations that are related to their existing specializations. The paper employs European Union Intellectual Property Office's (EUIPO) data to study 218 European NUTS-2 regions (16 countries) over the period 2000-16. Results show that increased technological stock is associated with more trademark applications and that existing trademark relatedness induces new specializations. These findings contribute to a better understanding of trademark activity and policies related to regional diversification including Smart Specialisation.

Modeling this activity, i.e., understanding how predictable human navigation is and whether regularities can be detected has been of interest to researchers for nearly two decades. This is crucial for improving the Web experience of users by e.g., enhancing interfaces or information network structures. This thesis envisions to shedding light on human navigational patterns by trying to understand, leverage and improve human navigation on the Web. One main goal of this thesis is the construction of a versatile framework for modeling human navigational data with the use of Markov chains and for detecting the appropriate Markov chain order by using several advanced inference methods. It allows us to investigate memory and structure in human navigation patterns. Furthermore, we are interested in detecting whether pragmatic human navigational data can be leveraged by e.g., being useful for the task of calculating semantic relatedness between concepts. Finally, we want to find ways of enhancing human navigation models. Concretely, we plan on incorporating prior knowledge about the semantic relatedness between concepts to our Markov chain models as it is known that humans navigate the Web intuitively instead of randomly. Our experiments should be conducted on a variety of distinct navigational data including both goal oriented and free form navigation scenarios. We not only look at navigational paths over websites, but also abstract away to navigational paths over topics in order to get insights into cognitive patterns.																					978-1-4503-2745-9				2014							27	31		10.1145/2567948.2567956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567948.2567956													WOS:000455947000005

Using discussion to inform action: Formative research on nature-based physical activity as a means of fostering relatedness for girls in physical and health education	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW												The long-standing challenges and issues associated with girls' disengagement from secondary school physical and health education (PHE) are serious and well documented. This disengagement has provided the incentive for the examination of alternative strategies to facilitate girls' engagement in PHE. This paper discusses the first phase in a formative research process designed to develop a resource manual to help teachers utilize nature-based physical activity (NBPA) as a means of fostering relatedness for girls in PHE. Participating teachers collaborated and generated specific NBPA ideas and pedagogical strategies during an all-day planning session. Four focus groups with the teachers (N = 20) were used to identify ways to develop NBPA interventions. Five broad topics are reported: (a) defining NBPAs, (b) specific NBPAs to use in PHE, (b) how NBPA can foster relatedness, (d) how NBPA in PHE differs from outdoor education, and (e) barriers to implementing NBPA in PHE. This paper emphasizes the valuable contribution of formative research to the integrity and fidelity of an intervention as well as to quality practice in the implementation of theory-based PHE initiatives.

Supporting students' need for relatedness (along with a need for competence and autonomy) is claimed to enhance behaviors that are self-motivated and self-determined. The purpose of this study is to explore the affordances of tablet technologies, such as Apple iPads, for satisfying young language learners' need for relatedness, both in classroom collaborative learning and social interactions beyond the school settings. The key findings of this qualitative study suggest the iPad's potentiality for promoting L2 motivation through exploiting its affordances to enhance collaborative learning and social development.																			1863-0383						2015	10	2					24	29		10.3991/ijet.v10i2.4313	http://dx.doi.org/10.3991/ijet.v10i2.4313													WOS:000366059300004

Complex pension products: A multidimensional approach	FINANCIAL INTERNET QUARTERLY												The study analyzes and assesses the economic and linguistic complexity of individual retirement products in Poland. For this purpose, an original multidimensional approach was used and various research methods were applied. We analyzed 75 out of 86 individual pension products (IKEs and IKZEs) offered in Poland in the first half of 2017, covering our analysis of nearly 90% of Poland's market of individual pension products. We performed the nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation analysis, we used hierarchical cluster analysis, analysis of variance, and a chi-square test to verify if there was a statistical relationship between the clusters and the type of financial provider and the type of individual pension product (IKE or IKZE). We also built also a map of the products that shows their economic and linguistic complexity. We find that high-fee products tend to have the most complex fee systems, suggesting that the complex fee system may be a strategy used by the providers of individual retirement products. Our results also indicate that individual retirement products are too complex for most individuals.

We propose a statistical framework to quantify location and colocation associations of economic activities using information-theoretic measures. We relate the resulting measures to existing measures of revealed comparative advantage, localization, specialization, and coagglomeration and show how different measures derive from the same general framework. To support the use of these measures in hypothesis testing and statistical inference, we develop a Bayesian estimation approach to provide measures of uncertainty and statistical significance of the estimated quantities. We illustrate this framework in an application to an analysis of location and colocation patterns of occupations in US cities.

J	Jaax, A				Jaax, Alexander			Skill relatedness and economic restructuring: the case of Bremerhaven	REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE												Evolutionary thinking suggests that past knowledge accumulation influences future growth opportunities. Old industrial regions' inherited knowledge is often described as obsolete. Particularly, blue-collar workers' difficulties in redeploying skills have been stressed. This study examines whether the emerging offshore wind-energy industry in Bremerhaven, Germany, can draw on skills from local declining shipyards. Beyond Germany, this new industry has inspired policy-makers to hope for the renewal of shipbuilding centres. Insights from interviews reveal that the blue-collar skill bases of both industries overlap. Declining shipyards provided much-needed experience and skills to the nascent industry. This contribution underscores the fruitfulness of the perspective of related variety with respect to the development of old industrial regions. An overly sharp distinction between 'old' and 'new' knowledge may obstruct our view of potential growth opportunities.																			2168-1376						2016	3	1					58	66		10.1080/21681376.2015.1116958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21681376.2015.1116958													WOS:000445837500004
J	De Noni, I; Belussi, F				De Noni, Ivan; Belussi, Fiorenza			Breakthrough Invention Performance of Multispecialized Clustered Regions in Europe	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												The regional literature of the last decades has been characterized by an extended debate on the role of regional diversification compared to specialization as a driver of innovation. In this context, the smart specialization framework has recently developed a balanced perspective by emphasizing the role of related diversification of the regional portfolio. Nevertheless, most of the empirical research on the topic has investigated the intensity rather than relevance of technological progress. This article contributes to this framework by exploring the breakthrough performance of European regions. In particular, by focusing on industry-region pairs in place of regions as a whole, the article attempts to claim that the ability to produce breakthrough inventions is higher in multispecialized clustered regions, since it depends on both the specialization of industries and the technological relatedness to the clustered industries of the region. The implications at the level of regional policies are huge, given that the potential of unrelated competitive industries might remain largely unexploited, and diversification in related, although not competitive, industries risks being unprofitable.

One of the objectives of this work is to contrast this theoretical consideration with the observed interaction between education and communication scientific journals defined by citations and relatedness towards other scientific journals. At the same time, there might be relevant differences between the citation patterns of Spanish and foreign (journals in Journal Citation Reports) communication journals, particularly with regard to their disciplinary composition. These differences might become a major problem for the interexchange of information be tween both sets of journals. The authors analyze the citations distribution by subject category for Spanish and JCR journals, as well as for the journal "Comunicar", and also the frequency of related journals per subject category in the case of JCR. It is concluded: a) that the aforementioned epistemological relationship is valid only for Spanish Communication journals, b) that there are relevant differences between both sets of journals in the disciplinary composition of their cited-citing and related journals and that Information Science & Library Science might serve as a suitable communication channel; finally, c) the characteristic multidisciplinarity of the journal "Comunicar" is corroborated, both at the national and international level.

These methods are needed to measure semantic similarity between two ontologies' entities to discover reliable correspondences. While existing similarity measures suffer from some difficulties, semantic relatedness measures tend to yield better results; even though they are not completely appropriate for the 'equivalence' relationship (e.g. "blood'' and "bleeding'' related but not similar). We attempt to adapt Gloss Vector relatedness measure for similarity estimation. Generally, Gloss Vector uses angles between entities' gloss vectors for relatedness calculation. After employing Pearson's chi-squared test for statistical elimination of insignificant features to optimize entities' gloss vectors, by considering concepts' taxonomy, we enrich them for better similarity measurement. Discussed measures get evaluated in the biomedical domain using MeSH, MEDLINE and dataset of 301 concept pairs. We conclude Adapted Gloss Vector similarity results are more correlated with human judgment of similarity compared to other measures.

Empirical results indicate that firm diversification is dependent on both intra- and inter-firm knowledge spillovers, though the effect of the former is much greater. More importantly, intra-firm knowledge spillovers are one key source of firm upgrading. In contrast, inter-firm knowledge spillovers even have some negative impacts on firm upgrading in the Chinese context, though it contributes to firm diversification. We further analyze how the roles of intra- and inter-firm knowledge spillovers in firm upgrading are contingent on regional institutional context.

Having this in mind, the article focuses on mapping sponsorship scenario in Indian Premier League (IPL) and aims at meeting three main objectives: (a) Mapping sponsorship scenario in Indian Premier League (IPL), (b) to categorize sponsors in Indian Premier League into various categories and highlight the importance of Industry-IPL fit and (c) to discuss the impact of micro-level factors on sponsorship-linked marketing. For the purpose, official websites of IPL and all teams were scanned (from 19 March to 3 April 2012) resulting into the identification of 119 sponsors with varying level of prominence, relatedness and sponsors' hierarchy. Researchers advised brand managers that they should first weigh their brand's prominence and relatedness coupled with taking into account their target customers rather than taking impulse decisions to compete with their competitors' sponsorship activities. The study contributes to the knowledge of the academicians who will be able to understand the potential of future researches that could be done. On the other hand, the study also provides an advantage to marketing executives/sport managers about how they can effectively and efficiently manage their individual brands in a cluttered media environment.																			2277-9752	2321-029X				JAN	2013	2	1					61	72		10.1177/2277975213496516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2277975213496516													WOS:000457910700006

The summer reading program was free for students in grades 1-8 and was designed to prevent reading-level losses during the summer for students from lower-income households or minoritized races or ethnicities. Using a mixed-method design, we tracked students' reading skill growth during the 6-week reading program; we then identified three student pairs with different patterns of change in their reading skills. Through the interview analysis, we explored what learning experiences in the classroom supported the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, especially for successful learners. Based on the findings, we suggest how teachers can support students who face difficulties with reading growth.

Specifically, whether cross-border acquisitions may hamper target firms' performance or enhance their sustainable competitiveness represents a highly debated research question. Building on the knowledge-based perspective of mergers and acquisitions, this paper directs attention to absorptive capacity and investigates the likelihood of survival of target firms acquired by foreign investors. In particular, it examines the role played by three potential antecedent conditions of an acquiring firm's absorptive capacity on the probability of the target firm's survival: (a) The business relatedness between acquirer and target, (b) previous experience of the acquirer in the host country, and (c) the cultural distance between the countries of the acquiring and acquired firms. Based on a sample of 396 Italian firms acquired by foreign multinationals, results suggest that target firms are more likely to survive in case the acquirer benefits from previous country-level experience and in case of business relatedness, while the cultural distance between the home country of the acquiring firm and Italy does not prove to be a significant determinant of survival versus mortality of acquired subsidiaries. Overall, our analysis confirms that context familiarity, in terms of both country and business contexts, plays a fundamental role in determining the sustainable competitiveness of acquired firms.

This travel behaviour involves tourists increasingly travelling to destinations they perceive to be critically threatened, while contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts in these very places. For last chance destinations to be managed effectively in the face of climate change, a clearer understanding of what drives this travel behaviour is needed. Drawing on the importance of place and nature to identity construction, this research uses a structural equation modelling approach to examine last chance tourism motivations in Churchill, Canada. Results provide evidence of a motivation to engage in a last chance experience. They also indicate that this motivation is related to a desire to share a connection to nature with similar individuals, and to become part of the local story. Beyond this, results show that visitors' sense of place identity and nature relatedness contribute significantly to their motivation to engage in last chance tourism.

Estimating the probability of clonal relatedness of pairs of tumors in cancer patients	BIOMETRICS												Next generation sequencing panels are being used increasingly in cancer research to study tumor evolution. A specific statistical challenge is to compare the mutational profiles in different tumors from a patient to determine the strength of evidence that the tumors are clonally related, that is, derived from a single, founder clonal cell. The presence of identical mutations in each tumor provides evidence of clonal relatedness, although the strength of evidence from a match is related to how commonly the mutation is seen in the tumor type under investigation. This evidence must be weighed against the evidence in favor of independent tumors from non-matching mutations. In this article, we frame this challenge in the context of diagnosis using a novel random effects model. In this way, by analyzing a set of tumor pairs, we can estimate the proportion of cases that are clonally related in the sample as well as the individual diagnostic probabilities for each case. The method is illustrated using data from a study to determine the clonal relationship of lobular carcinoma in situ with subsequent invasive breast cancers, where each tumor in the pair was subjected to whole exome sequencing. The statistical properties of the method are evaluated using simulations, demonstrating that the key model parameters are estimated with only modest bias in small samples in most configurations.

Therefore, it is imperative to focus research on teacher autonomy in specific tasks, using data collection procedures suitable to the context. In this study, the aim is to validate an original scale for collecting data on teacher autonomy in classroom settings under criteria established by Self-Determination Theory, in the framework of basic psychological needs. The method comprises a nonexperimental quantitative design, using a random cluster sample that is understood as a probability sampling because participant teachers only work in primary education levels. Results demonstrate that the scale possesses a strong degree of robustness regarding construction, application, and data collection. In conclusion, the validated scale identifies teacher autonomy as an explanatory variable in the model.

J	Glock, EN				Glock, Eric N.			Off Dependence on the Highway to Hell and on to the Stairway to Heaven	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES												As global climate change becomes an increasing problem, so will supply shocks, whether in terms of suppression, mitigation, or adaptation. Economics is largely unprepared to entreat these. Supply shocks are often misunderstood as hyperinflations brought on by increased money creation instead of as a fundamental shortfall in habituated consumption. Entreating supply shocks will be more akin to returning Apollo 13 to Earth than it will be to burying bank notes. Modern Monetary Theory's roots provide a solution. MMT is fundamentally a theory that supposes that capacity is the only constraint upon the abilities of economies. MMT, outside of this, has argued that inflation effectively indicates that capacity is being strained. This paper suggests that current prices are being used as a proxy for capacity by both a congressional budget and an MMT approach. It hopes to develop MMT in terms of its institutionalist roots. This article will point out some of the issues that arise with the use of prices as a proxy for capacity-and inflation as a measure of its limits. The paper's primary concern is to determine how society might fit into a lettuce wrap: a consumption space bounded by universal subsistence and zero-non-renewable resource use.																			0021-3624	1946-326X				APR 3	2022	56	2					387	399		10.1080/00213624.2022.2056360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00213624.2022.2056360													WOS:000826885000011

Thirty-five native English speakers and 30 L2 learners participated in two experiments. Experiment i showed that learners were able to use lexicality as a cue to segment L2 speech. The lexicality effect significantly interacted with L2 proficiency. Experiment 2 showed that learners did not use semantic cues to the same extent as native listeners did. All participants experienced more difficulty with word boundary identification preceded by /s/. This difficulty may stem from weak allophonic cues of /s/ in English. L2 learners with better proficiency may be better at recognizing familiar words from continuous speech, thus more efficiently utilizing the lexicality cue.																			2542-3835	2542-3843					2018	1	1					166	198		10.1075/jsls.17017.lin	http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/jsls.17017.lin													WOS:000663804600008
J	Qiao, YB; Wu, D				Qiao, Yibo; Wu, Di			Relatedness, Complexity and Regional Diversification in the European Union: The Role of Co-inventor Networks	TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE												We investigate the role of both internal and external co-inventor networks in regional diversification. The impact of co-inventor networks on regional technological diversification is tested for a data set containing 1,495,699 patents in 643 technologies in 290 European regions at the NUTS-2 level, between 1987 and 2016. Our results show that both internal co-inventor network connectivity and external co-inventor network linkages could benefit regional technology entry and prevent regional technology exit. However, too inwardly oriented or outwardly connected co-inventor networks would hamper patent production. Regarding regional diversification, we find that both internal and external co-inventor networks could facilitate the entry of related technologies and restrain the exit of complex technologies. This paper contributes to the literature by initiating the integration of the complexity dimension into analysing the role of co-inventor networks in regional diversification. This research bears significant policy implications for the advancement of Smart Specialization Strategy in the European Union.

MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF LEARNING & INSTRUCTION												Purpose -Collaborative learning has been increasingly recognized as an effective approach to promote students' success in higher education. To better understand the factors that contribute to successful collaborative learning, this study applied the Biggs' presage-process -product (3P) general model of learning to investigate the role of teaching quality, student-faculty interaction, and relatedness as presage factors, collaborative learning as process factor, and reflective and integrative learning and higher-order thinking as product factors.Methodology -A cross-sectional approach was applied in this study, which included 1,892 Malaysian undergraduates. The study used the Quality of University Learning Experience (QULEX) survey to measure various constructs. First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to establish the psychometric properties of the instruments. Thereafter, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to evaluate the latent variables relationships.Findings - Based on the findings, collaborative learning fully mediated the prediction of student-faculty interaction, teaching quality, and relatedness on reflective and integrative learning and higher-order thinking.Significance -These findings suggest that collaborative learning with social components and effective teaching maximize students' learning activities, and they should be fostered in academic institutions to improve students' academic success. Implications for improving teaching and learning are also discussed in this paper.

J	Chandera, Y				Chandera, Yane			Business groups and the impact of industry relatedness on firms' borrowing costs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS												PurposeThis study analyzes whether industry relatedness between a corporate borrower and its group peers significantly affects that firm's borrowing cost.Design/methodology/approachA regression analysis is run on bank-loan data of a sample of Indonesian companies for 2010-2020. The main variables of interest are the natural logarithms of the borrowing firm's number of affiliates classified within either similar 2- or 4-digit GICS industries, and the Caves weighted index of these firms' related diversification. This index measures how firms in a group are diversified in relation to the borrower. The dependent variable is the all-in credit spread, stated in basis points, over the LIBOR or similar benchmark, as of the loan issuance date.FindingsFindings support the industry-relatedness hypothesis and contradict the risk-reduction hypothesis and show that banks charge lower loan spreads on a borrowing firm that either operates within a similar industry as its affiliate or diversifies into related sectors or industries. Consistent with the co-insurance-effect hypothesis, the results also underline the importance of the parent and first-layer firms as supporting instead of the tunneling vehicles within business groups. These conclusions hold even after segregating the sample and using the loan maturity as the dependent variable.Originality/valueThis study uses a unique diversification measurement based on the borrowing firm's sector or industry, relative to other group members, and offers new insights on business group diversification and bank loan costs.

Classroom video data, collected throughout a multi-week writing assignment, were analyzed using a discourse analytic approach, focusing on how student and teacher used linguistic resources (such as personal pronouns and modal verbs), as well as how they co-constructed the context for learning. Findings enabled greater understanding of the ways in which participants negotiated issues of power, role, and responsibility over the course of an academic project. The relationships built in this particular special education learning environment supported the focus student in seeing learning supports and strategies as acceptable, useful, and desirable; these relationships also allowed him opportunities to develop the self-regulatory skills and feelings of relatedness critical to strong self-determination beliefs.

Based on the results of 110 participants, this study suggests preservice early childhood educators perceive parks as the most conducive outdoor setting for achieving educational outcomes, specifically structured learning about nature, and that they are more inclined to use maintained outdoor settings than natural outdoor settings. The strongest predictors of intention to use natural outdoor settings were perceived difficulty in using natural settings, participants' level of nature relatedness, and the degree to which they agreed that experiences in nature were important for young children's health and wellness. Barriers to address include perceived lack of access to natural settings and safety concerns.																			1350-4622	1469-5871					2012	18	5					643	664		10.1080/13504622.2011.640749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504622.2011.640749													WOS:000309607500004

In our paper, we analyze the changes in total natural rents (rents from coal, mineral, natural gas, and forest) by digital businesses (e-commerce, involving shopping online, turnovers e-commerce, trading on e-commerce web, and business electronically, involving the use of customer relationship management (CRM), and cloud usage). From 2011 to 2019, a sample of 26 countries from the European Union was examined using various econometric approaches. Our estimation results demonstrate that digital businesses cause a rise in overall natural rents. More precisely, the rents for coal and gas appear to be more influenced by an enterprise's integration of digital technologies. On the other hand, digitalization in the business sector tends to lower coal rents and mineral and woodland rents. Notably, knowledge-sharing is the most crucial component to promote the efficiency of digitalization in preventing natural rent-seeking.

An Automatic Online Recruitment System based on Exploiting Multiple Semantic Resources and Concept-relatedness Measures	2015 IEEE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI 2015)	Proceedings-International Conference on Tools With Artificial Intelligence				27th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)	NOV 09-11, 2015	Vietri sul Mare, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Biol & Artificial Intelligence Fdn, ICTAI, Seconda Univ Studi Napoli, Italian Assoc Artificial Intelligence, Soc Italiana Reti Neuroniche, Int Inst Adv Sci Studies, Univ Patras				Due to the rapid development of job markets, traditional recruitment methods are becoming insufficient. This is because employers often receive an enormous number of applications (usually unstructured resumes) that are difficult to process and analyze manually. To address this issue, several automatic recruitment systems have been proposed. Although these systems have proved to be more effective in processing candidate resumes and matching them to their relevant job posts, they still suffer from low precision due to limitations of their underlying techniques. On the one hand, approaches based on keyword matching ignore the semantics of the job post and resume contents; and consequently a large portion of the matching results is irrelevant. On the other hand, the more recent semantics-based models are influenced by the limitations of the used semantic resources, namely the incompleteness of the knowledge captured by such resources and their limited domain coverage. In this paper, we propose an automatic online recruitment system that employs multiple semantic resources to highlight the semantic contents of resumes and job posts. Additionally, it utilizes statistical concept-relatedness measures to further enrich the highlighted contents with relevant concepts that were not initially recognized by the used semantic resources. The proposed system has been instantiated and validated in a precision-recall based empirical framework.

WORLD ECONOMY												We highlight a new dimension of the submarine cable infrastructure network, termed 'digital connectedness', reflecting a country's digital proximity to main world markets and assess its impact on export upgrading. Using an instrumental variables approach conducted on a sample of 60 developing countries-including 23 sub-Saharan African countries-over the period 1995-2017, we find that digital connectedness contributes positively and significantly to the export basket complexity but also points out spatial heterogeneity within our sample. In fact, estimations stress that compared to the Rest of the World, a 10 pp increase in the share of world GDP directly cabled to SSA countries leads to a supplementary increase ranging from 4.6 index points to 5.3 index points in the export complexity index. Moreover, while everywhere else the positive effect of digital connectedness declines with distance from global markets, in sub-Saharan Africa the benefit increases. Finally, in line with the literature, improved digital connectedness also translates into higher exports of differentiated goods and greater participation in the global value chain.						da PIEDADE, Camille/0000-0002-2064-786X; Cariolle, Joel/0000-0001-7292-9829													0378-5920	1467-9701				NOV	2023	46	11			SI		3325	3344		10.1111/twec.13501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/twec.13501		SEP 2023											WOS:001074027000001
J	Jiang, YC				Jiang, Yuncheng			Semantically-enhanced information retrieval using multiple knowledge sources	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS												Classical or traditional Information Retrieval (IR) approaches rely on the word-based representations of query and documents in the collection. The specification of the user information need is completely based on words figuring in the original query in order to retrieve documents containing those words. Such approaches have been limited due to the absence of relevant keywords as well as the term variation in documents and user's query. The purpose of this paper is to present a new method to Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) to solve the limitations of existing approaches. Concretely, we propose a novel method SIRWWO (Semantic Information Retrieval using Wikipedia, WordNet, and domain Ontologies) for SIR by combining multiple knowledge sources Wikipedia, WordNet, and Description Logic (DL) ontologies. In order to illustrate the approach SIRWWO, we first present the notion of Labeled Dynamic Semantic Network (LDSN) by extending the notions of dynamic semantic network and extended semantic net based on WordNet (and DAML ontology library). According to the notion of LDSN, we obtain the notion of Weighted Dynamic Semantic Network (WDSN, intuitively, each edge in WDSN is assigned to a number in the [0, 1] interval) and give the WDSN construction method using Wikipedia, WordNet, and DL ontology. We then propose a novel metric to measure the semantic relatedness between concepts based on WDSN. Lastly, we investigate the approach SIRWWO by using semantic relatedness between users' query keywords and digital documents. The experimental results show that our proposals obtain comparable and better performance results than other traditional IR system Lucene.																			1386-7857	1573-7543				DEC	2020	23	4					2925	2944		10.1007/s10586-020-03057-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-020-03057-7		FEB 2020											WOS:000516010300001

We have also taken into consideration the specific cultural characteristics of higher education in Hong Kong. The result is an academic service-learning program which is compulsory yet includes a wide selection of subjects, structured instructions balanced with student-based learning, challenging as well as meaningful service projects, and a growing set of boundary-crossing, international projects in far away radically different cultures.

Results of structural equation modeling showed that: (a) Prosocial behavior at Time 1 positively predicted SWB in school at Time 4. (b) The satisfaction of relatedness needs at school at Time 2 mediated the path from prosocial behavior at Time 1 to SWB in school at Time 4; the mediating effect of self-esteem at Time 3 between prosocial behavior at Time 1 and SWB in school at Time 4 was not significant. (c) Prosocial behavior at Time 1 showed indirect effects on SWB in school at Time 4 successively via the satisfaction of relatedness needs at school at Time 2 and self-esteem at Time 3. Limitations of the study and implication of the results were discussed.

This study employed a mixed-method research approach, using post-tests, questionnaires and focus group interviews during the data collection process. Sixty-one students were the respondents involved in a non-randomised experiment with a control group design, while 10 representative students participated in a focus-group discussion. The results reported that post-test 1 showed no significant difference between the two groups of flipped and non-flipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p = .474), while post-tests 2 and 3 were significantly different (t = 5.54, p = .007 < .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 < .05). This finding shows that students in the flipped learning environment were more competent handling online tasks and activities, and were able to control their learning outcomes.The survey results showed that the flip-class setting fostered better peer interaction and autonomous learning skills among the students.The flip-class environment had also a positive influence on students'intrinsic motivation. The qualitative findings from the students'interviews revealed that students were motivated by the video-recorded lectures, self-regulated learning environments, engagement in class activities and peer interaction. Conclusions from this study showed that the flip-class setting had successfully established the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy and relatedness in a flipped classroom model.

Cultural models in communication with infants: Lessons from Kikaikelaki, Cameroon and Muenster, Germany	JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH												Child rearing is a universal task, yet there are differing solutions according to the dynamics of socio-cultural milieu in which children are raised. Cultural models of what is considered good or bad parenting become explicit in everyday routine practices. Focusing on early mother-infant interactions in this article we examine the discursive practices and strategies that foster cultural values such as autonomy and relatedness. Drawing on micro-analysis of videotaped mother-infant interactions from middle-class families in Muenster, Germany and farming Nso families in Kikaikelaki, Cameroon, we aim at illustrating how diverse discursive strategies construct alternative versions of the child's experience of self and self-in-relation-to-others. In each case, mothers draw on discursive practices that convey cultural norms and values that fit the relevant cultural context.

HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT												Early career academics (ECAs) represent the future of the academic workforce, but competition and career uncertainty is resulting in disengagement and burnout. In professions outside academia, increased engagement is associated with perceived organisational support and fair recognition and rewards, as well as opportunities to meet basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness. In contrast, decreased engagement is linked with increasing demands on effort and over-commitment to work. The current study used multiple linear regression to test whether comparable relationships were observed in a sample of 151 ECAs in an Australian university. Opportunities to build and demonstrate competence at work, the presence of meaningful relationships and perceived organisational support were independent and statistically significant predictors of engagement. The need for autonomy and fair rewards and recognition appeared to be correlated but not statistically significant predictors of engagement. Contrary to prediction, increasing effort and over-commitment to work did not predict decreases in engagement. These results are discussed in light of implications for programs designed to support the development of ECAs into various career pathways.

The knowledge-based perspective highlights the critical role that the acquirer's target's knowledge absorption plays as the main driver in enhancing post-M&A technological performance. However, absorptive capacity is a rather complex construct, which includes assimilation, utilisation and transformation of the acquired knowledge. In this paper, we focus on knowledge utilisation and investigate two factors whose effects on post-M&A technological performance have been extensively highlighted: technological relatedness and managerial experience. We contribute to the existing literature with a better understanding of the factors underlying the utilisation of the knowledge acquired in M&As. This should help managers to enhance their capacity to manage integration process post-M&As. Our results are based on a cross-sectional data set of 152 biopharmaceutical acquirers that completed at least one M&A between 2001 and 2005.

Data were collected from 817 5th and 6th grade students, 862 middle school students and 844 high school students, boys and girls. The findings supported an a priori correlated 3-factor structure of the Basic Psychological Needs in Physical Education scale (BPN-PE) with strong internal reliability for all three school grade levels. Support was also obtained for the nomological validity of the scale responses. Further, measurement invariance emerged for BPN-PE scores across boys and girls and across students who participated or not in out-of-school sports within each school grade level as well as across all three school grade levels.

J	Coleman, P				Coleman, Phil			The Theory of Human Relatedness as a Potential Underlying Causative Mechanism in Nursing Student Placement Experiences: A UK-Based Critical Realist Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING-IJRVET												Context: This study, underpinned by Critical Realism, re-analysed interview data acquired to examine the views and experiences of four stakeholder groups involved in the delivery of employer-sponsored pre-registration nursing programmes offered by a UK university in which all students already held an appointment as a non-registrant carer and who completed their placements within a block or integrated practicum framework. The re-analysis focused on the extent to which this interview data aligned with the key propositions of the Theory of Human Relatedness and therefore whether this theory, congruent with assertions based on the results of an earlier realist synthesis, might provide a causative explanation of factors affecting nursing student placement experiences. Methods: Semi-structured, digitally recorded and professionally transcribed interviews, each lasting approximately 30 minutes, were held with a purposive sample of 37, predominantly female, respondents in 4 stakeholder groups involved in employer-sponsored pre-registration nursing programmes. These stakeholder groups were students, employers, mentors, and practice tutors and were associated with programme provision within twelve healthcare organisations in northern England. Results: Although more modest in some areas, data provides support for every key proposition identified within the Theory of Human Relatedness; suggesting this theory may closely reflect the criteria that stakeholders implicitly employ to evaluate placement models. More respondents in all groups described the block practicum model in ways that suggest it is best able to promote a sense of connectedness, belonging and synchrony for learners. In contrast, an integrated placement design was portrayed in terms that implied it may increase the risk of disconnectedness but might also be more likely to promote reciprocity. Insufficient data was available to identify the perceived effect of either practicum design in respect of enmeshment, parallelism, and mutuality. Conclusion: The results of this research suggest that a block placement may foster more positive relatedness experiences for students and other stakeholders within nursing programmes. Moreover, the extent to which a practicum framework is perceived to promote connectedness, belonging, reciprocity and mutuality, to minimise disconnectedness and enmeshment and to reduce the need for parallelism may underpin stakeholder appraisal of the two practicum frameworks. Little research regarding the effect of placement duration and intensity on student learning within pre-registration healthcare programmes or the application of the Theory of Human Relatedness to practicum experiences, however, has been undertaken to date and such investigation is complicated by inconsistent terminology to describe practicum designs. It is argued that further academic enquiry within both fields should be a priority for healthcare educators; not least because it may provide further insights into curriculum designs capable of reducing student attrition.

Stages of productive sophistication and smart industrial policies	STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS												Development studies on the middle-income trap have highlighted the challenges for developing economies to transform their productive systems from simple towards high value-added activities. Here, we use trade data of 116 countries to quantify the stages of productive sophistication and reveal the crit-ical phase that countries encounter at intermediate levels of economic sophistication. Our results reveal that only five countries (i.e. Ireland, Israel, Hungary, Singapore, and South Korea) overcame the gravitation towards simple products and fully transformed their economies towards complex products between 1970 and 2010. They successfully made use of windows of opportunities in the digital and electronics sectors through smart industrial policies that promoted endogenous skills and access to international knowledge sources. In contrast, countries like Brazil or South Africa still struggle with the gravitation towards simple economic activities, social fragmentation, and a lack of coherent industrial policies.

J	Zargarzadeh, H				Zargarzadeh, H.			Achille and the Unhomely Pull of Atavistic Homeland in Derek Walcott's Omeros	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES												Pan-Africanists and proponents of Negritude associate home with Africa. However, Derek Walcott detours from this essentialist belief. My interpretation of his epic poem, Omeros (1990), provides a detailed analysis of Walcott's negative attitude toward Negritude. Among the characters in Omeros, this paper focuses on Achille's quest for self and identity in Africa. Taking Homi Bhabha's concept of the "unhomely" as an analytical tool, I will show how Walcott critically illustrates the unhomeliness of Africa as home for Afro-Caribbeans. Even though essentially Africa is regarded as the ancestral homeland for people of African descent, the uncanny feeling it creates, negates this association. Yet, Omeros proposes that the New World itself, in spite of its ambivalences, can be home for the New World inhabitants as it could create a sense of familiarity-or what Yi-Fu Tuan terms "topophilia"-and a communal sense of relatedness. As I will argue, these features can be taken as characteristics of home and can create, albeit not a true home, but a sense of at-homeness with the context of the new location.																			0128-7702	2231-8534				JUN	2016	24	2					825	837																WOS:000391178400018

Effects of a positive education programme on secondary school students' mental health and wellbeing; challenges of the school context	OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION												Previous research has demonstrated wellbeing benefits for positive education programmes (PEPs) facilitated by clinicians or experts or outside the school context. The current study explored the effects of a Year 10 PEP led by teachers trained in positive education and embedded within the Australian secondary school context. A mixed-methods design compared students receiving PEP (n = 119) with a wellbeing-as-usual comparison group (n = 34) matched on age and socioeconomic status. Depression, anxiety, autonomy, gratitude and mindfulness levels did not differ between groups. Levels of satisfaction with life and relatedness were significantly higher for the intervention than for the comparison students at the post-intervention time point. Qualitative analyses revealed that students valued having engaging and relatable teachers, brief interactive sessions and personally relevant applied content. School-based PEPs may therefore provide some limited ongoing support as students transition into their senior years of secondary school. Delivering positive education within the school context, however, raises challenges relating to levels of teacher training and availability. Capturing the student voice in the current study was valuable and indicated that both teacher and programme factors were central to student engagement in PEPs.

Understanding green regional path development: a systematic study of the Nordic regions	REGIONAL STUDIES												This paper addresses the gaps in understanding green regional path development and the role of firm-level agency in driving regional green transitions. By analysing a large patent dataset covering 30 years, we provide a systematic account of green regional path development in 70 regions across four Nordic countries. We identify six types of green path development - extension, stagnation, extinction, diversification, renewal and creation - and explore how different types of organisations - incumbents and new entrants - contribute to these paths. We show that regions often have multiple green paths, and the dominant types are mostly driven by incumbents.

To counter this, the World Health Organization recommends at least 30 minutes of activity, such as walking, every day. We present a system making use of fitness trackers to gather step counts and showing them using a gamified mobile app and a gamified public display. We performed a four-week in-the-wild study (N=12) to evaluate the system and the effects of introducing a public display on walking behavior. We found that adding the public display significantly increased step counts and users' motivation to walk, which seems to be attributable to the significant increase in social relatedness. In semi-structured interviews, we learned that besides encouraging socialization, the public display made participants aware that their step data is visible for outsiders and that they could be confronted with their performance, providing additional motivation to increase their step counts.

In this work, a sequential ensemble, that uses an efficient distance-relatedness based clustering, "Mitosis", followed by the centre-based K-means algorithm, is proposed. K-means is used to segment the clusters obtained by Mitosis into a number of subclusters. The ensemble is used to reveal the gradual change of patterns when applied to gene expression sets.

However, research on the topic yields ambiguous results in different cultural contexts. While the positive association between motivation and science achievement has been evidenced universally, the relatively predictive effect and strength of different motivational factors in different cultures need additional examination. To tease the potential discrepancy apart and explore different student motivational factors including self-concept, intrinsic value, utility value, and sense of relatedness, this study examines grade 8 students from the U.S. (N = 14,290) and Singapore (N = 6113) by using the International Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data. The results suggest that the U.S. student self-concept in science learning is the strongest and most significant predictor of their science achievement. In Singapore, students perceived utility value in science learning has the strongest and most significant association with their science achievement.

Therefore, this research investigates MNCs' strategic motivation in acquiring BUs and how they manage the post-acquisition integration at the BU level. Specifically, this article focuses on studying the pivotal role of acquired BU's product lines in determining the degree and speed of integration. Using multiple case study method in cross-border acquisitions, the analysis reveals three findings. First, acquired BU's product lines are the strategic motive for the acquirer MNCs and, therefore, become significant in the decisions taken during post-acquisition integration. Second, the three phases of acquired product lines, namely marketed, upcoming, and Research and Development (R&D) pipeline, set the speed of integration from fast to slow. Third, acquired product lines' market relatedness determines the degree of integration between the acquirer and acquired BUs.

Based on social exchange theory, the authors propose that leader BLM will promote employee social cyberloafing behavior via psychological contract breach, especially when employee needs for relatedness is high.Design/methodology/approachTo test the hypotheses, the authors conducted a multi-wave, multi-source field study with 185 paired employee-leader dyads at three time points. The hypotheses were tested by Mplus with a bootstrap approach to obtain confidence intervals.FindingsThe results show that leader BLM has a positive impact on employee social cyberloafing behavior, which is mediated by psychological contract breach. In addition, employee needs for relatedness moderates this process. Specifically, when employees pertain high needs for relatedness, the influence of leader BLM will be stronger.Practical implicationsThis research paper highlights the detrimental influence of leader BLM and provide directions for preventing employee cyberloafing behavior.Originality/valuePrevious studies have drawn inconsistent conclusions on the effectiveness of leader BLM, such as enhancing task performance and eliciting social undermining. This study further explores the underlying mechanism linking leader BLM to employee social cyberloafing behavior and the boundary conditions. This has subsequently provided practitioners with new perspectives regarding why employees engage in counter-productive social cyberloafing.

The aim of this study, therefore, is to account for economic complexity index (ECI), Brexit and other crisis episodes in the growth-energy-emissions nexus. Theoretically, the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model is assessed by adopting a One-step System Generalized Method of Moment (Sys GMM) on data for 26 EU member states over the period from 1995 to 2018. For the first time, an EU-macro regional analysis is conducted with and without the UK. Empirical results reveal that an increase in tourism, real GDP per capita, and energy use across the four EU macro regions leads to increase in carbon emission. In some regions, it was observed that tourism, ECI, Brexit, and the Greece bailout have no significant impact on carbon emission. This suggests that the increase in international travel, complexity of the economy, and financial crisis do not accelerate environmental crisis in such regions. However, where such factors are statistically significant, Brexit and the Greece bailout crisis both heighten emissions.

J	Obery, A; Bangert, A				Obery, Amanda; Bangert, Arthur			Exploring the Influence of Nature Relatedness and Perceived Science Knowledge on Proenvironmental Behavior	EDUCATION SCIENCES												This study was undertaken to investigate the factors influencing proenvironmental behavior of individuals residing in the Northern Rocky Mountains (N = 267). Measures of relatedness to nature and perceived science knowledge were collected through a convenience sample approach using multiple avenues such as city email lists, organizational newsletters, and social media channels. Analysis of the data was conducted using both partial least squares and covariance based structural equation modeling to explore the relationships between the constructs. Additionally, qualitative definitions of proenvironmental behavior were investigated in order to address potential gaps between self-reported and observed behaviors. Quantitative findings show a renewed positive connection between science education, nature relatedness, and proenvironmental behaviors. Furthermore, qualitative findings suggest positive relationships between how publicly people are willing to share their passion for the outdoors and their willingness to engage in proenvironmental behaviors.

Drawing on recombinant innovation theory, we maintain that regions find it harder to specialise in technologies with a more siloed knowledge base, and that this hampering effect is more pronounced for more cognitively unrelated new technologies. Using data from the European Patent Office, with respect to sub-national regions of the EU28, we proxy the siloed degree of the regional knowledge base with the weight of Single Patent-code Inventions (SPIs) over total patents by region-technologies and test our hypotheses over the 1986-2017 period. We find that the relative number of SPIs by regional technologies - i.e. the siloed extent of these technologies - negatively correlates with the regions' capacity to specialise in them. This negative correlation attenuates with respect to the specialisation in more cognitively closer new technologies. For very high levels of technological relatedness, the correlation becomes positive and the SPI incidence tends to enable technological diversification, rather than contrasting it. Policy implications are drawn accordingly.

Using a firm-level data set, we show that reformed SOEs have learned more from non-SOEs about how to promote economic performance. Empirical results also confirm that the effectiveness of the SOE reform is contingent on regional institutional contexts.

We did retrospective interviews with young adults who are dedicated to acting for nature in order to find patterns in their life experiences that contribute to their relationship with nature and drive their action for nature. We found that autonomous early childhood nature experiences build a foundation for young adults' connection with nature. In early adolescence, engagement with nature takes flight after moments of wonder, significant life experiences, or encounters with like-minded peers. Some interviewees experienced a temporary lack of interest in nature during puberty. Using self-determination theory as a theoretical lens revealed that the basic psychological needs - relatedness, autonomy, and competence - manifested throughout the young adults' lives. We use our findings to indicate both directions for future research and practical implications.						van Heel, Bernadette/0000-0003-2738-5644													0964-0568	1360-0559				2023 NOV 22	2023										10.1080/09640568.2023.2281875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2023.2281875		NOV 2023											WOS:001135065200001

The economic industrial complexity approach is employed to examine the impact of market forces and historical legacies on the crash of the centrally controlled spatial equity organization of jobs and industries and the shift to a more uneven economic landscape. A long time series of data spanning more than 30 years in Slovakia revealed how the artificial territorial organization of job creation policies in each district, enabled by central state planning, has gradually disintegrated. The results display significant spatial divergence and inequality between the capital city and the rest of the country, as well as between urban and rural areas. Two contrasting cases of Bratislava and Kosice, the two largest cities in the country, show different spatial relationships with their surrounding regions, explainable using backwash and spread effects. Since spatial and sectoral dynamics are interconnected, spatial shifts and industrial change occurred together. The emergence of creative and knowledge-based economic activities took place against the backdrop of old industrial policies. Kosice, the second largest city in Slovakia, faces growing intraregional disparities, so it is worth examining at a micro level how its sectoral trajectory has shifted away from heavy industry thanks to investment in information and communication technology (ICT) and the successful European Capital of Culture project. The microscale of the city reveals patterns of the gradual occupation of territory by the creative sector, particularly by culture and arts, ICT firms and research and development (R&D) entities, exhibiting different locational behaviors.																			2063-9538	2064-8243				2024 APR 12	2024										10.15196/RS140203	http://dx.doi.org/10.15196/RS140203		APR 2024											WOS:001203625000001

The core concept of this proposal is to identify paraphrases when sentences contain a set of named entities and common words. The developed approach distinguishes the computation of the semantic similarity of named entity tokens from the rest of the sentence text. More specifically, this is based on the integration of word semantic similarity derived from WordNet taxonomic relations, and named-entity semantic relatedness inferred from the crowd-sourced knowledge in Wikipedia database. Besides, we improve WordNet similarity measure by nominalizing verbs, adjectives and adverbs with the aid of Categorial Variation database (CatVar). The paraphrase identification system is then evaluated using two different datasets; namely, Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) and TREC-9 Question Variants. Experimental results on the aforementioned datasets show that our system outperforms baselines in the paraphrase identification task.																			2325-0623		978-1-7281-0441-6				2018							203	210		10.1109/SKG.2018.00037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SKG.2018.00037													WOS:000469092200028

Specifically, by integrating the literatures on business models, diversification, and acquisition strategy, we provide a conceptual analysis of how business model relatedness may influence performance implications of M&As. When business models among acquirers and targets are related, the sharing and transfer of superior resources may improve post-acquisition performance. In contrast, when business models among acquirers and targets are unrelated, internal and external identity conflicts may harm post-acquisition performance. Moreover, the conceptual framework developed in this study suggests that even if acquirers and targets are related in a product and geographical market sense, dissimilarities across business models may still harm post-acquisition performance. Overall, we suggest that using the recently emerged concept of business model may provide a new step in examining diversification decisions above and beyond the traditionally examined concepts of product and geographical markets, providing a more complete understanding of when and how multibusiness firms can create value.

The paper points out that blindness in strategy is one of the main causes. Therefore, decision-making on M&A direction, which is the key to establish M&A strategy and is helpful to enhance the efficiency of the overall decision-making process, should be paid close attention by both theoretical and practical field. M&A direction decision-making is to find out the optimal route within the limited territory determined by a firm's capability and resources, and to locate candidate targets in a more concrete scope. Thus, it can be concluded that decision on M&A direction is the antecedent phase of target selection. The paper focuses on analyzing the attribute and preference of each type of firm resource in the context of mergers, and discusses M&A direction from two crucial dimensions including geographical span and industrial relatedness.																					978-7-5614-3663-9				2007							414	420																WOS:000246274400061
J	Kumar, M; Jauhari, H				Kumar, Manish; Jauhari, Hemang			Satisfaction of learning, performance, and relatedness needs at work and employees' organizational identification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT												Purpose - In today's scenario when loyalty can no longer be demanded from employees, the extent of organizational identification (OID) of employees predicts outcomes of organizational interest. It is therefore essential for organizations to foster the sense of oneness in employees. Since, need satisfaction lies at the core of human motivation, the purpose of this paper is to test if satisfaction of learning, performance, and relatedness needs at workplace could influence employees' identification with the organization. Design/methodology/approach - For this study, the authors collected data from 365 professionals representing diverse work backgrounds and analysed it using structural equation modelling approach. Findings - Results suggest that OID is positively influenced by satisfaction of these three needs and about 45 per cent of its variance is explained by these needs. Originality/value - The study corroborates the relevance of the three needs in organizational context. Although not a part of design of the study, nonetheless the study sheds light on methodological and theoretical possibilities of salience of needs. Therefore to the best of awareness, this study stands apart from other studies exploring relationship of disparate needs with OID. The authors believe the study enriches social identity theory literature in indicating that researchers should not only consider focusing on relationship of needs variables with OID but also the dynamics of interaction between various needs among themselves as well as on their differential relationship with OID.																			1741-0401	1758-6658					2016	65	6					760	772		10.1108/IJPPM-01-2016-0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPPM-01-2016-0006													WOS:000381909200003
J	Pehrsson, A				Pehrsson, Anders			Foreign value-adding of industrial firms Associations with international strategy and market experience	JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT												Purpose - There is a lack of research on how the industrial firm's international strategy is associated with basic and advanced value-adding modes of the wholly owned foreign subsidiary. The purpose of this paper is to fill the gap by answering two questions: how are relatedness between the firm and the foreign subsidiary, and the firm's international scope associated with foreign subsidiary's value-adding mode? How does the subsidiary's market experience moderate the relationships? Design/methodology/approach - The study develops a conceptual model that integrates strategy theory and internationalization theory in order to explain basic value-adding modes (promotion, sales, and after-sales services), and advanced modes that also include product development and/or production. Also, the study tests the model using statistical data from subsidiaries of Swedish firms operating in Germany, the USA, and the UK. Findings - It was found that greater relatedness between the core business unit of the parent firm and the foreign subsidiary favors a basic mode. However, the foreign subsidiary's market experience weakens the relationship, and the interaction triggers an advanced mode. Also, greater international scope of the firm favors an advanced mode. Research limitations/implications - The model test shows that research needs to consider both international strategy and market experience in explaining value-adding modes of an industrial firm's wholly owned subsidiary. Practical implications - By using the study contributions the industrial firm's efforts to efficiently implement international strategy would become more efficient as strategy coherence will increase. Originality/value - This paper contributes to literature on international strategy and internationalization by showing that international strategy and market experience of foreign markets mutually impact value-adding modes of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.

As CROKODIL enables the forming of possibly large learning communities, the stored data is growing in a large scale. Thus, an appropriate recommendation of tags and learning resources becomes increasingly important for supporting learners. We propose semantic relatedness between tags and resources as a basis of recommendation and identify Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) using Wikipedia as reference corpus as a viable option. However, data from CROKODIL shows that tags and resources are often composed in different languages. Thus, a monolingual approach to provide recommendations is not applicable in CROKODIL. Thus, we examine strategies for providing mappings between different languages, extending ESA to provide cross lingual capabilities. Specifically, we present mapping strategies that utilize additional semantic information contained in Wikipedia. Based on CROKODIL's application scenario, we present an evaluation design and show results of cross lingual ESA.					Rensing, Christopher/D-3947-2011; Steinmetz, Patrick R.

We focus on status-related processes that complement the ambiguities involving social categorization and information processing perspectives. We further identify the theoretically meaningful mediators (i.e. innovative climate, employee competence and employee satisfaction) of the diversity-performance relationship at the organization level. We empirically validate our hypothesis using time-lagged, multi-source data collected from 256 Korean manufacturing companies at 2 time points over a 2-year period. Results indicate that hierarchical position diversity is negatively related to employee competence and satisfaction, which in turn negatively affects operational performance. Education diversity positively affects innovative climate, employee competence and employee satisfaction, thus increasing the innovation and operational efficiency of an organization. This study elaborates the distinct implications of diversity dimensions with different levels of status-relatedness, and offers empirical contributions that highlight the mediating mechanisms through which diversity enhances different forms of organizational performance.

It also serves as the basis for accurate searching of valuable teaching video clips. While keyframe-based story segmentation has achieved remarkable results in news videos, achieving accurate story segmentation in teaching videos is challenging. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised teaching video story segmentation method called SegRewardGraph, which utilizes a subtitle length-rewarding strategy and semantic relatedness graphs. SegRewardGraph employs subtitle semantic similarity to divide video stories, ensuring semantic integrity and improving the accuracy of story segmentation. Specifically, SegRewardGraph first uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model combined with first-last-avg pooling to encode semantic vectors for sentences within video stories. Then, it computes similarities between all sentence vectors and utilizes the associations to build semantic relatedness graphs. A subtitle length-rewarding strategy is formulated to evaluate the segmentation effect. Additionally, boundary detection and boundary merging algorithms are designed based on the subtitle length-rewarding strategy to generate effective segmentation suggestions. Finally, the selected boundaries are mapped to keyframes, enabling semantic content-based segmentation of teaching videos. This study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method using massive open online courses (MOOC) teaching video datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results for teaching video segmentation tasks.

J	Knox, BD				Knox, Brian D.			A replication about cause-effect linkage benefits and managers' strategic judgments	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT CONTROL												Managers must constantly scan a sea of new information and judge (1) if this information is relevant to evaluating the firm's strategy (i.e. information relevance judgments), and (2) if this information suggests the firm's strategy is appropriate or inappropriate (i.e. strategy appropriateness judgments). I examine these judgments in a behavioral experiment with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. Replicating prior research, I test how these judgments are affected by formatting the firm's strategy to include cause-effect linkages, a defining feature of strategic performance measurement systems. I also add a manipulation of causal relatedness, i.e. the subjective probability of a given cause-effect linkage, especially as it relates to the inferred bridging mediators that can logically connect a cause-effect linkage. Like prior research, I find that adding cause-effect linkages improves managers' information relevance judgments, specifically improving managers' ability to filter out irrelevant information. Extending prior research, I also find that cause-effect linkages only improve strategy appropriateness judgments when those linkages have high causal relatedness. Experience also moderates this latter improvement such that it is limited to those with relatively low experience.																			2191-4761	2191-477X				JUN	2021	32	2					225	251		10.1007/s00187-021-00315-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00187-021-00315-6		FEB 2021											WOS:000619452600001

The proposed approach focuses on above problem by processing documents on sentence level using different semantic similarity relations of WordNet between sentence words and list of weighted query words expanded through encyclopedia Wikipedia. According to initial results, our approach performs well with MAP of 0.28 and P@10 of 0.64 with improvement of 27% over baseline results.

J	Di Lorenzo, F; Sabel, CA				Di Lorenzo, Francesco; Sabel, Christopher Albert			Corporate Venture Capital and Startup Outcomes: The Roles of Investment Timing and Multiple Corporate Investors	INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION												The effects of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments on ventures' revenues and innovation-related outcomes depend on the characteristics of the investors and on the dynamics of the investment process. Recently, venture financing literature has highlighted the importance of investment timing as a driver for investee ventures development and success. Building on the literatures on complementary assets and relative absorptive capacity, we explore how the timing of CVC investments affects ventures' revenues and R&D intensity. Using a dataset of Norwegian ventures in knowledge-intensive industries, we find evidence for a differential effect of CVC investments when comparing a venture's early- and late-stage, showing that investments received in late-stage increase ventures' revenues, but decrease ventures' R&D intensity. Further, we find that syndication with multiple CVC investors amplifies this effect. This study contributes to the understanding of the CVC-venture relationship and the impact on venture's post-CVC outcomes.

This is accomplished by means of a database covering all workers who became redundant in major shutdowns or cutbacks in Sweden between 1990 and 2005. Frequencies of industrial and geographical mobility are described over time, and the influence of some important characteristics that make workers more likely to be subject to particular forms of mobilities are assessed. We find that re-employment rates vary extensively across industries and time. Whereas going back to the same or related industries is the most common re-employment strategy among workers who find a new job in the first year, workers who do not benefit from quick re-employment are increasingly squeezed out to new job fields and regions. Older workers and workers with high vested interest in their original industries usually employ a same-industry/same-region' strategy. This most frequent, and perhaps often most attractive, same-industry strategy comes at a cost, however. Individuals who instead pursue other mobility strategies have a lower risk of suffering from another major redundancy in the future. Thus, in terms of regional policy, strategies promoting diversification to related industries after major redundancies seem to be much more important than trying to retain workers in their old industry. In this case the route via education (university or vocational training) is important, as it increases the likelihood of successfully changing industry at time of re-employment.

These spaces provide habitat for biodiversity and, as evidence from the Global North shows, can provide health and wellbeing benefits to urban dwellers. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the wellbeing benefits associated with urban green and blue spaces from the Global South, where the fastest rates of population growth and urban expansion are occurring. Here, we examine green and blue spaces in Georgetown, Guyana, exploring whether frequency and duration of use is (1) associated with nature-relatedness, safety concerns, and sociodemographic characteristics, (2) associated with specific visit motivations (e.g. physical, cognitive, social), and (3) associated with wellbeing (positive and negative experiential, evaluative, eudaimonic, and mental wellbeing). Participants (n = 512) were more likely to visit green and blue spaces if they had higher naturerelatedness, no safety concerns, aged <35 years, and educated above secondary level. Visit frequency was not related to wellbeing. Visit duration did not differentiate according to visit motivations. Visits to green and blue spaces of more than 25 min were associated with increased positive experiential wellbeing. No comparable patterns were found for the other wellbeing dimensions. These findings can inform public health campaigns targeted at specific sociodemographic groups. Moreover, decision-makers could minimise health inequalities by incorporating new green and blue spaces into future development plans (including the provision of backyards), and enhancing existing spaces (e.g. reducing people's safety concerns). These measures will help maximise wellbeing across all sectors of society.

Self-Determination and Environmental Attitudes	EDUCATION SCIENCES												Environmental attitudes are supportive for learning about the environment and for pro-environmental engagement. The question, then, is how to strengthen and establish environmental attitudes. Based on a sample of 429 middle and high school students, we investigated the effect of self-determination-based motivation on environmental attitude. While high levels of self-determination (i.e., intrinsic motivation) positively affected pro-environmental attitude (beta = 0.40), low levels of self-determination (i.e., external regulation) negatively affected attitude (beta = -0.31). Our data further pointed to a distinct trajectory of self-determination and inclusion of nature throughout adolescence (high scores for 12-year-olds that decline to a minimum around 15-16-years old); a trend that has already been shown for environmental attitude. Such a dip might help derive teaching recommendations in environmental education, e.g., by supporting high scores in time to attenuate a decline. Further teaching recommendations include strengthening students' self-determination through their basic needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness).

J	Martin, P				Martin, Peter			Caring for the Environment: Challenges from Notions of Caring	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION												In 2003 John Fien presented an argument for environmental education to encompass deep and wide caring for human and nonhuman nature (Fien, 2003). His philosophical discussion of care outlined work by Nel Noddings (1984; 1992). In this paper I continue that project by indicating how Noddings' work provides signposts for environmental educators to think about their students' relationships with the nonhuman natural world. I argue that one consequence of Noddings' conception of care is that advocacy for considering humans to be a part of nature might be counterproductive to developing a student's capacity to understand a caring relationship with nature.

J	Zhu, XD; He, CF; Gu, ZT				Zhu, Xiangdong; He, Canfei; Gu, Zhutong			How do local policies and trade barriers reshape the export of Chinese photovoltaic products?	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The past two decades have witnessed the dramatic growth of the photovoltaic (PV) industry in China. This study examines the impact of both internal and external forces on China's solar PV export during 2007-2016. The results show that the spatial pattern of PV exports is quite different before and after 2011, with export increasingly concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta. The statistical analysis finds that, despite the crucial role of industrial relatedness, the export of PV products has deviated from historical trajectory of regional product structure with the impact of external forces. Policy incentives are essential in stimulating PV exports by compensating for the shortage of industrial bases in the central and western regions. Trade protectionism has depressed China's PV exports. The eastern region has a better performance in alleviating loss since it has strong industrial bases and can bear trade shock by quickly switching PV production to related sectors. This study suggests the importance of external forces from both domestic and abroad in shaping the development of export-oriented industries in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Considerably less attention has been directed to aspects that result in the opposite, namely a surface approach. Indeed, there is a small literature focusing on how learning environments can frustrate the basic psychological needs of individuals and, as a result, foster a surface approach. However, hitherto, this stream has focused on controlling elements in learning environments. We add to this latter literature, through focusing on learning-environment uncertainty. This notion emerged from a qualitative study of 19 students at a Swedish university, where we identified three types of learning-environment uncertainty, related to the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The findings suggest that a surface approach to learning can be understood as a coping strategy that students adopt to reduce such uncertainties.

While in high-income countries several studies have shown that creative industries are highly innovative and productive, positively impacting the local economy, the evidence is scarce for middle-income countries. Using employment data, we studied the agglomeration patterns of creative industries in Colombia between 2008 and 2017. We found a positive relationship between creative industries' agglomeration and employment in non-creative services industries. However, using a shift-share instrumental variable approach, we found no significant causality of an increase in creative industries' employment on employment growth in other industries.

Variation in experiences of nature across gradients of tree cover in compact and sprawling cities	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban environments are expanding globally, and by 2050 nearly 70% of the world's population will live in towns and cities, where opportunities to experience nature are more limited than in rural areas. This transition could have important implications for health and wellbeing given the diversity of benefits that nature delivers. Despite these issues, there is a lack of information on whether or how the experience of nature changes as green space becomes less available. We explore this question for residents of two case study cities of varying urban designs, sprawling (Brisbane, Australia) and compact (three English towns, U.K). Second, we examine how people's feelings of connection to nature (measured using the Nature Relatedness scale) vary across this same gradient of nature availability. Despite climatic and cultural differences we found substantial similarities between the two locations. Lower levels of neighbourhood tree cover were associated with a reduced frequency of visits to private and public green spaces, and a similar pattern was found for the duration of time spent in private and public green spaces for Brisbane. Residents of both urban areas showed similar levels of nature relatedness, and there was a weak but positive association between tree cover and Nature Relatedness. These results suggest that regardless of the style of urban design, maintaining the availability of nature close to home is a critical step to protect people's experiences of nature and their desire to seek out those experiences.

Most recent schema matching systems require a manual double-check of the matching results to add missed matches and remove incorrect matches. Manual correction is labor-intensive and time-consuming, however without it the results accuracy is significantly lower. In this paper, we present xMatcher, an approach to automatically match XML schemas. Given two schemas S-1 and S-2, xMatcher identifies semantically similar schema elements between S-1 and S-2. To obtain correct matches, xMatcher first transforms S-1 and S-2 into sets of words; then, it uses a context-based measure to identify the meanings of words in their contexts; next, it captures semantic relatedness between sets of words in different schemas; finally, it uses WordNet information to calculate the similarity values between semantically related sets and matches the pairs of sets whose similarity values are greater than or equal to 0:8. The results show that xMatcher provides superior matching accuracy compared to the state of the art matching systems. Overall, our proposal can be a stepping stone towards decreasing human assistance and overcoming the weaknesses of current matching initiatives in terms of matching accuracy.

Lack of semantic information in the web services profiles poses a restriction in the automated discovery of services. Irrelevant and huge number of services returned by the UDDI and lack of standard mechanisms are the main problems faced by the users today during service discovery. In this paper, we propose a Web service discovery approach independent of the description model that tries to manage with the heterogeneity found in semantic service description frameworks. This proposed approach uses the principals from text mining, measures of semantic relatedness and information retrieval where the semantic information of the services is integrated with the syntactic service profiles to give hybrid service vectors. Empirical evaluation of the proposed approach implemented on OWL-X services has been presented to show the feasibility of the approach. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach is able to discover better semantic relationship between services, therefore, more relevant results are ensured during discovery.

Therefore, there is a number of job portals and recommendation systems trying to help users filter this massive amount of offers when searching for the right job. Until today, most of these systems' searching techniques are confined to using keywords such as job titles or skills, which also returns many results. This paper proposes a job recommender system that exploits the candidate's resume to select the appropriate job. Our system, AnnoJob, adopts a semantic annotation approach to: (1) intelligently extract contextual entities from resumes/offers, and (2) semantically structure the extracted entities in RDF triples using domain ontology, providing a unified presentation of the content of the documents. Furthermore, to select the suitable offer, we propose a novel semantic matching technique that computes the similarity between the resume/offers based on identifying the semantic similarity and relatedness between the RDF triples using the domain ontology and Wikidata, which enhance job-ranking results over existing information retrieval approaches. We evaluate our system using various experiments on data from real-world recruitment documents.

These attitudes can give rise to negative social experiences for students of color (i.e., discrimination), negatively impacting their mental and physical health and creating disparities in educational outcomes. Rather than seeking to ameliorate these negative experiences, our approach attempts to address the underlying prejudices and, in so doing, reduce these disparities. Using 4 waves of data from a cluster randomized trial (N = 15 middle schools, 1,890 students, 47.1% female, 75.2% White), we hypothesized that cooperative learning, which has been shown to reduce prejudice in previous research, would create positive gains in peer relatedness, perceptions of academic support, and engagement in learning, and that gains would be larger for students of color; our results confirmed these hypotheses. Our findings highlight the potential role of cooperative learning in reducing disparities and creating greater equity in education.																			0022-0671	1940-0675				AUG 14	2020	113	4					283	291		10.1080/00220671.2020.1806016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00220671.2020.1806016		AUG 2020						33664528					WOS:000560218900001

The semantic metadata embedded with the resources is typically linked to ontologies or taxonomies. Meta information can bring a number of advantages for users. However, the ontologies might contain some errors or could be partially inconsistent. Therefore it is important to evaluate the quality of ontologies at various levels. Existing evaluation methods either investigate whether the ontologies are "fit for purpose", or focus on evaluating ontology consistencies from a single aspect. In this study, we focus on ontology consistency evaluation methods, which consider lexical, taxonomic and syntactic aspects at the same time. We propose new measures, which capture several essential aspects simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new measure through a case study and an extensive set of experiments.

And do local or nonlocal establishment founders create most novelty in a region? We develop a theoretical framework that focuses on the roles different agents play in regional transformation. We then apply this framework, using Swedish matched employer-employee data, to determine how novel the activities of new establishments are to a region. Incumbents mainly reinforce a region's current specialization: incumbent's growth, decline, and industry switching further align them with the rest of the local economy. The unrelated diversification required for structural change mostly originates via new establishments, especially via those with nonlocal roots. Interestingly, although entrepreneurs often introduce novel activities to a local economy, when they do so, their ventures have higher failure rates compared to new subsidiaries of existing firms. Consequently, new subsidiaries manage to create longer-lasting change in regions.

However, there are many exporters who do not obey the traditional path and enter foreign markets at the beginning of their internationalization, so called 'born globals (BGs)'. It seems that the BGs are more path-breaking, but the relative influence of local export network on both types of exporters remains an open question. Using firm-market level database of Chinese custom statistics during 2002-2011, we confirm that local export network of markets facilitates firms including BGs to enter the markets that are more related to the network. And the BGs even benefit more from the local export network of markets than traditional exporters (TEs).																			0014-0015					JUL-SEP	2020	74	3					179	190		10.3112/erdkunde.2020.03.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2020.03.02													WOS:000583865500002

By using the product space theory, this paper explores the path -dependent characteristics in national renewable energy product diversification and focuses on whether the digital economy entails countries to further break path -dependent trajectories for path creation. The results indicate that renewable energy product evolution is path -dependent, and countries tend to branch out into products related to their original production structure to develop into new renewable energy products. Moreover, the digital economy reduces the impact of correlation on product evolution to lead to path creation in national renewable energy products. In addition, solar products are more affected by the digital economy than other renewable energy sources, and the path -creating effects of the digital economy are more pronounced in countries with a weak productive capacity. The study provides an effective reference for countries on how to break the constraints of production capacity of renewable energy products and contributes to promoting the synergies between digitalization and green low -carbon transition.

Questionnaires measuring satisfaction of the need for autonomy, competence and relatedness, teacher self-efficacy, emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depersonalization were completed by 220 Transylvanian Hungarian and Hungarian (Hungary) high school teachers. Results show significant correlations between perceived need satisfaction and all three aspects of teacher burnout. Demographic factors (e.g. gender, school profile) were in significant relationship with satisfaction of the need for autonomy and need for competence and also depersonalization. Satisfaction of the basic needs predicted burnout components.

Evidence from European regions	PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE												The aim of the paper is to shed light on the role played by regional knowledge bases in Industry 3.0 in fostering new technologies in Industry 4.0 in European regions (NUTS 3) over the period 1991-2015. We find that 4.0 technologies appear to be quite related to 3.0 technologies, with some heterogeneity among different technology fields. The paper investigates the geographical implications. We find that the probability of developing Industry 4.0 technologies is higher in regions that are specialized in Industry 3.0 technologies. However, other types of knowledge bases also sustain regional diversification in Industry 4.0 technologies.

In this model, each concept node in the hierarchical tree has ancestor and descendent concept nodes composing its relevancy nodes, thus a concept node is represented as a concept vector according to its relevancy nodes' local density and the similarity of the two concepts is obtained by computing the cosine similarity of their vectors. In addition, the model is adjustable in terms of multiple descendent concept nodes. This paper also provides a method by which this concept vector may be applied with regard to HCG into HCT. With this model, semantic similarity and relatedness are computed based on HCT and HCG. The model contains structural information inherent to and hidden in the HCT and HCG. Our experiments showed that this model compares favorably to others and is flexible in that it can make comparisons between any two concepts in a WordNet-like structure without relying on any additional dictionary or corpus information.

J	Auerswald, P; Dani, L				Auerswald, Philip; Dani, Lokesh			Entrepreneurial opportunity and related specialization in economic ecosystems	RESEARCH POLICY												Entrepreneurial ecosystems are most often defined as locally bounded networks of institutions and individuals that help entrepreneurs to identify and exploit market opportunities. However, a prerequisite of the ability to exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity is the existence of the opportunity to begin with. In this paper, we propose an approach to representing how entrepreneurial opportunities are embedded in a regional economy. The central methodological contribution of our paper is to introduce the concept of related specialization, which we define as the concentration of high interdependencies between specialized industries within a metropolitan region, relative to the national level of concentration. We find that related specialization is positively correlated with entrepreneurial outcomes across U.S. metropolitan areas. We use related specialization to make a first attempt at representing the trophic structure of an economic ecosystem. In a biological ecosystem, the trophic structure refers to energy-transfer relationships between different species. As introduced in this paper, we propose the analogy that, in an economic ecosystem, the trophic structure may be mapped in terms of the supply-chain relationships between industries within a region. We argue that these analytic tools can help policymakers more readily understand the opportunities that are imminently available to entrepreneurs in their local environments.																			0048-7333	1873-7625				NOV	2022	51	9							104445	10.1016/j.respol.2021.104445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2021.104445		NOV 2022											WOS:000907874500012

In particular, the main element of originality of this work is to have singled out the determinants of the technological progress intensity and relevance. We acknowledge the importance of knowledge assets for new knowledge production, and we identify path-dependent processes that allow a region to become increasingly competitive in terms of innovation potential. In particular, adopting an evolutionary view of regional development, we describe the regional knowledge space through four crucial characteristics: 1) technological knowledge base, 2) technological cumulativeness, 3) technological diversification, and 4) technological relatedness. We then measure to what extent each of the knowledge space's characteristics differently affects the technological progress intensity and relevance of the region. A longitudinal study of 269 European regions over the period 1996-2012 was organized using data from REGPAT and Eurostat databases. Results show that technological relatedness affects positively both the intensity and relevance of the technological progress of European regions and that the other components of the knowledge space show a different impact on the two features of the technological progress. Finally, implications for EU policies supporting and stimulating regional technological progress are discussed.

By establishing new connections between technologies, they enable technological development through processes of recombinant innovation. In this paper, we develop a set of indicators that help us to characterise technologies in terms of their bridging function and study their evolution over time. We apply these tools to the regional and national levels in Germany. Our findings indicate that large patenting regions are not necessarily the ones that embed most new technologies in their knowledge space. For the German knowledge space we find that during the past two decades, it became less dependent on prominent technologies, such as transport, machinery and chemicals. Changes in the German knowledge space in terms of the development of new bridging technologies can be attributed to a regionally dispersed process rather than one driven by single regions.

It is one of the fundamental global problems of today as it is declining in space and time. The aim of this research was to determine the relationship of man and nature and to analyze the influence of variables such as gender, age, pet ownership, cultivation of plants, and perception of popular and unpopular animals. A total of 549 respondents took part in the research survey. In addition to the above-mentioned demographic variables, the research also contained 5 items related to the perceived vulnerability of respondents and 37 items focused on the perception of wolves and bees as example of unpopular or popular animals. All variables except gender had a significant influence on man's relationship to nature. Students who perceived their own vulnerability to a greater extent had a more negative attitude towards nature. Fear of both groups of observed animals had a negative influence on the relationship to nature. Other dimensions correlated positively, age as well as plant growing and pet breeding. In the end, the possibilities of improving the relationship to nature are suggested.

Lexical resources have been applied to analyzing text in a wide range of applications. However, manual compilation of lexical resources is difficult to keep up with the rapid increase of the volume and diversity of user-generated content on the web. Automatic concept hierarchy construction has been considered as one solution to the above problem. Despite extensive effort on automatic construction of concept hierarchies, few studies have focused on the concepts of specific domains. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for building a domain-specific concept hierarchy. By synthesizing different types of measurements of relatedness among concepts, we propose an integrated method for building a multi-branch hierarchy of product features from online consumer reviews. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm successfully reconstructs almost an entire hierarchy except for missing a few concepts and links. Starting from scratch, the algorithm reconstructed about 60% of the manually constructed hierarchy. The proposed method can be used to improve search results by better understanding user queries, and to facilitate personalized recommendations in e-commerce.																					978-1-4799-4860-4				2014							471	476																WOS:000366517200086

However, most of universities do not know why and how to integrate technology into pedagogical practice effectively and efficiently. This paper discusses the impact of technology-integrated teaching in improving learners' higher-order thinking through learners' relatedness fulfilment and deep learning. A quasi-experimental study has been done and a total of 180 undergraduate students enrolled in two courses in the university of South China participated in the study. ANOVA analysis revealed that students who participated in the technology-intervened classroom show statistically significant in higher-order thinking skills than students who did not participate in the blended learning classroom.

Does Spending Time in Nature Help Students Cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic?	SUSTAINABILITY												The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our economy, social lives, and mental health, and it therefore provides a unique chance for researchers to examine how people cope with changes to their everyday activities. Research suggests that people may be spending more time in nature than they did pre-pandemic. The current study sheds light on how nature is being used to cope with the stresses of the global health crisis and lockdowns. Canadian undergraduate students (N = 559) filled out a questionnaire during the fall of 2020 about their pandemic experience, including their affects, life satisfaction, and feelings of flourishing and vitality, in addition to a wide variety of nature variables. The weekly exposures, the perceived increases or decreases in the exposure to nature during the pandemic, and the feelings of connectedness (nature relatedness) were assessed. Those who felt like they were spending more time in nature than they did pre-pandemic experienced more subjective well-being. Nature-related individuals were more likely to access nature and to appreciate it more during the pandemic than others, but all people (even those less connected) experienced well-being benefits from spending more time in nature. Going into nature appears to be an increasingly popular and effective coping strategy to boost or maintain subjective well-being during the pandemic.

Urban biodiversity is also important because of the ecosystem services they provide, restorative benefits for well-being, and physical health of the people who live in urban areas. Each city has its own strategies to cope with this issue, and these strategies do not function without the contribution of habitants of the cities. We developed an index (BBS) of the existing possibilities to support urban biodiversity in Berlin to measure the awareness and willingness of the Berliners to participate and support urban biodiversity. A survey was conducted in a face-to-face situation in four districts of Berlin with 431 urban residents, measuring preference for three different levels of biodiversity, connectedness to residential greenspace, neighborhood and city, nature relatedness, and willingness in participatory actions around greenspace. The results show that the high biodiversity condition in a photo scenario was preferred by most residents, indicating the appreciation for urban biodiversity. The connectedness to the residential greenspace was high (and higher than the connectedness to neighborhood and city), showing large potential for quality of life. While the overall willingness to participate in actions to support urban greenspace was rather high, our index shows substantial differences in activities, which are perceived more or less. This is a key result for urban park management to increase urban biodiversity participation processes.																				2624-9634				SEP 12	2022	4								952790	10.3389/frsc.2022.952790	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frsc.2022.952790													WOS:000911895700001

The present paper attempts to improve the existing literature on assessing M&A activity in Indian corporate. The primary objective is to analyse 1) When synergies are gained, payment is made in cash, 2) When synergies are gained, M&A activity takes place in the related industries. The paper has analysed 20 major M&A deals which took place between 2010 and 2015 for the Indian Corporates. The data includes three year pre-merger , year of merger and three year post merger i.e. a total of seven year data for each deal has been used in the study effectively from 2007 to 2018. Random Effect Logit Regression has been applied to estimate the relationship. The major results derived from the analysis suggest that EBITDA has statistically significant relation with payment dummy as well as Industry relatedness. Statistically significant results have also been observed for Free Cash flow. Asset Turnover has also shown to have a significant relationship with relatedness of industry in our model. The results supports both the hypothesis of the study i.e. "When synergies are gained, cash mode of payment is preferred." and "When synergies are gained, mergers & acquisition in related industry sector are preferred".

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	QUEST												The Self-Determination Theory argues that individuals are optimally motivated when their three Basic Psychological Needs (BPNs) are satisfied, which can be influenced by the learning environment created by the teachers. Student-centered frameworks are permeating worldwide. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the effects of pedagogical models-based interventions in the promotion of students' BPNs. Four databases were searched, and twenty-five articles were retrieved. It was found that most programs had a positive impact on the students' BPNs, but they also uncovered interventions with no effects and a few with mixed results. The present review provides information not only to understand the effects of pedagogical models on the students' BPNs, but also to recognize the elements that could increase the success of future intervention programs.

J	Petralia, S; Balland, PA; Morrison, A				Petralia, Sergio; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre; Morrison, Andrea			Climbing the ladder of technological development	RESEARCH POLICY												Despite being the main thriving force behind economic growth and industrial development, technological innovation remains highly concentrated on a handful of countries. It is therefore of a great interest to know how countries accumulate and develop their innovative capabilities, what kind of obstacles they need to overcome, and whether it is possible to identify opportunities to develop new areas of technological specialization. In this paper we analyze countries' patterns of technological diversification and specialization along the development process. We provide evidence regarding the importance of existing technological capabilities and the relationship among technologies in shaping possible paths of technological development. We show that the likelihood of diversification is higher for those technologies that are related to countries' existing profile of competences. Moreover, we show this effect to be stronger at earlier stages of development. Additionally, we show that countries tend to follow clear patterns of specialization along the development path, by moving towards more complex and valuable technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sheffield, D; Butler, CW; Richardson, M				Sheffield, David; Butler, Carly W.; Richardson, Miles			Improving Nature Connectedness in Adults: A Meta-Analysis, Review and Agenda	SUSTAINABILITY												With clear links between an individual's sense of nature connectedness, their psychological wellbeing, and engagement in nature-friendly behaviours, efforts to improve people's relationships with nature can help unite human and planetary wellbeing. In the context of a rapidly growing evidence base, this paper updates previous meta-analytic reviews to explore the impact of (quasi-) experimental manipulations and field interventions on nature connectedness in adult populations. The analysis examines the relative effects of type of contact (direct or indirect), quality of engagement (active or passive) and the timing of the engagement (single session, repeated practice or residential). Results show a medium positive short-term mean effect of manipulations on nature connectedness, with similar effect sizes for immediate and sustained increases. No effect size differences were observed between different types of contact, quality, or timing of engagement. Follow-up measures were mostly used in studies involving regular and repeated practices. An agenda for future research and practice is put forward, emphasising the need for examining a wider range of nature engagement activities, greater understanding of factors leading to increases in nature connectedness, design and testing of practices for sustained nature connection, and initiatives that engage people with nature, create conditions for nature connection, and encourage repeated nature engagement activities.

J	Daude, C; Nagengast, A; Perea, JR				Daude, Christian; Nagengast, Arne; Perea, Jose Ramon			Productive capabilities: An empirical analysis of their drivers	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT												Recent contributions to the growth and trade literature have argued that the structure of an economy, as measured by its productive capabilities, is a key determinant for inter-country differences in development. Productive capabilities have been shown to be highly predictive of future economic growth, yet the country-level variables associated with them remain relatively unknown. In this paper, we empirically explore what variables are systematically associated with productive capabilities using a model averaging framework that can handle a very large number of potential explanatory variables without the need for arbitrary model selection. In order to estimate our dynamic panel specification, we propose a novel Bayesian averaging of classical estimates procedure based on the simple and efficient bias-corrected least squares dummy variable estimator. Our baseline and robustness analysis consider a large number of variables, sample periods and model priors. We find that there is persistence (as measured by the lagged dependent variable) and that variables, such as commodity terms of trade, energy availability, government consumption, capital per worker, arable land and capital inflows show a strong and robust association with capabilities.

Deciphering landscape preferences: Investigating the roles of familiarity and biome types	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Although people generally have positive evaluations of natural environments and stimuli, theory and research suggest that certain biomes are more preferable than others. Existing theories often draw on evolutionary ideas and people's familiarity with biome types, with familiarity being the most supported, albeit not conclusively, in existing research. Across three samples (n = 720) we sought to compare preference ratings of 40 images that represented ten biomes (beach, lake, tropical and temperate forest, marsh, swamp, meadow, park, mountain, and river). We addressed objective familiarity by recruiting samples from two distinct geographies (Florida and Ontario), and we assessed subjective familiarity via image ratings. Familiarity was positively associated with liking biomes, though this trend was stronger for subjective familiarity compared to geography. Substantial variation in biome type preferences could not be attributed to familiarity. Specific biome types were strongly preferred irrespective of familiarity and geography. e.g., beaches and lakes were highly preferred, while marshes and swamps were substantially less preferred than other biome types. Further analyses found that the individual difference of nature relatedness predicted both familiarity and liking of all biomes except beaches, and that there was a lack of seasonal effects (fall and winter) across two Ontario samples. We discuss how results provide qualified support for the familiarity view, limits of this interpretation, how methodological choices such as the number of ratings might impact findings, and the potential applications of these results in landscape design.																			0169-2046	1872-6062				OCT	2021	214								104189	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104189													WOS:000678114700002

Optimising Employee Mental Health: The Relationship Between Intrinsic Need Satisfaction, Job Crafting, and Employee Well-Being	JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES												Organisations are frequently confronted with the issue of how to enhance employee mental health. Based on self-determination theory, a model is proposed that examines the relationships between job crafting, the satisfaction of the intrinsic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness at work, and employee well-being-defined here as both subjective well-being and psychological well-being. A sample of 253 working adults completed a battery of questionnaires including the Job Crafting Questionnaire, the Intrinsic Need Satisfaction Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum. Using structural equation modelling methods, it was determined that job crafting predicted intrinsic need satisfaction, which, in turn, predicted employee well-being. The results suggest that job crafting may be an important underpinning upon which to base an employee well-being intervention.

J	Shirazi, M				Shirazi, Masoud			Advancing the affordable and clean energy in large energy-consuming economies: The role of green transition, complexity-based, and geostrategy policies	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												With decreasing costs of the clean technologies, the balanced scales of the Sustainable Development Goal 7 targets, e.g., energy equity (EE), energy security (ES), and environmental sustainability (EVS), are quickly changing. This fundamental balancing process is a key requirement for a net-zero future. Accordingly, this research analyzes the regime-switching effect of Hydrogen economy as the green transition, sharing economy and economic complexity as the complexity-based, and geopolitical risks and energy prices as the geostrategy policies on the Goal 7 targets. To this end, a Markov-switching panel vector autoregressive method with regime-heteroskedasticity is applied to study advancing the Goal 7 in the world's twenty-five large energy consumers during 2004-2020. Concerning the parameters and statistics of the model, the results refer to the existence of two regimes associated with the Goal 7 corners, called "upward and downward" regimes for EE and "slightly upward and sharply upward" regimes for ES and EVS. It is revealed that the vulnerability of EE and ES targets is considerably reduced when the regime switches to the dominant regime that is "downward" and "slightly upward" regimes respectively, and that of the EVS target remains unaffected. Through the impulse-response analysis, the findings denote that the first hypothesis of the efficiency of the Hydrogen economy in promoting the Goal 7 targets is insignificant. However, the significant short-term and dynamic shock effects of the complexity-based and geostrategy policies on the Hydrogen economy are detected, which will be a feasible alternative assessment in advancing the Goal 7. Further, the complexity-based policies support the Goal 7 targets under different regimes, especially in the short- and medium-term. Hence, the second hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the complexity-based policies in promoting Goal 7 targets is confirmed. The third hypothesis concerning the complexity of the impact of geostrategy policies on the Goal 7 targets is verified. Particularly, the switching process towards the Goal 7 may not necessarily be restricted by the geopolitical risks. Moreover, EE is supported through energy prices in the short-term under both regimes, while they are non-conductive to promote ES and EVS through time. Accordingly, the decision-makers should acknowledge adopting a regime-switching path forward for ensuring the time-varying balanced growth of the Goal 7 targets as the impact of the suggested policy instruments is asymmetric.

J	Henning, M				Henning, Martin			Regional labour flows between manufacturing and business services: Reciprocal integration and uneven geography	EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES												This article uses Statistics Sweden's full-population geo-coded register data for Swedish workers and their labour market moves, between 2010 and 2014, to analyse regional flow patterns of employees between manufacturing, general business services and knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). The findings generally show that labour flows between manufacturing and services have important bi-directional features, even with manufacturing generally declining. There is no staff exodus from manufacturing to services, but rather an exchange suggesting skill interdependencies, especially between high-tech manufacturing and KIBS. However, there are strong geographical dimensions to this, emphasising a reinforcement of the spatial division of labour patterns. In trend terms, the decline of manufacturing is rather similar across all regional types; however, business services are growing much faster in metropolitan regions. The labour flow between manufacturing and KIBS is more likely in metropolitan regions, but far more often additionally involves geographical mobility, either between or towards the metropolitan regions. Thus, the major challenge facing less dense and peripheral regions is not necessarily the decline of manufacturing per se, but that (a) the low levels of transition into business services are insufficient to make up for employment losses in manufacturing and (b) the fact that there is considerable out-migration of experienced and skilled workers from manufacturing, who are joining the growing numbers of business services in metropolitan regions.																			0969-7764	1461-7145				JUL	2020	27	3					290	302		10.1177/0969776419834065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0969776419834065													WOS:000538198200006

However, their rate of introduction in service sectors, especially the medical and healthcare sectors, is much slower than expected. Technology convergence may be one of the keys to promote the introduction of robots in new sectors e.g., the medical & healthcare sectors. Technological relatedness including technology convergence has been measured by various methodologies using citation network analysis, clustering, or technology similarity. Although these measurements could identify the overall characteristics of technology convergence, more detailed analyses are required to identify the specific patterns and instances of this convergence. The purpose of this research is first, to identify the technology convergence more precisely than before by using a new methodology named "module-based mining methodology;" second, to extract the patterns of technology convergence; and finally to examine the processes of technology convergence in the field of robotics research. This study would enable researchers and policymakers to achieve accelerated development of new products and services for new sectors including the medical and healthcare market.

While Wikipedia has already been used in IR, the application of Wiktionary in this task is new. We evaluate two retrieval models, i.e. SR-Text and SR-Word, based on semantic relatedness by comparing their performance to a statistical model as implemented by Lucene. We refer to Wikipedia article titles and Wiktionary word entries as concepts and map query and document terms to concept vectors which are then used to compute the document relevance. lit the bilingual task, we translate the English topics into the document language, i.e. German, by rising machine translation. For SR-Text, we alternatively perform the translation process by using cross-language links in Wikipedia, whereby the terms are directly mapped to concept vectors in the target language. The evaluation shows that the latter approach especially improves the retrieval performance in cases where the machine translation system incorrectly translates query terms.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-642-04446-5				2009	5706						219	226																WOS:000273344500028

Although, in relevant literature, Forest School is seen as highly conducive to participants' motivation to learn, there is no theoretical framework that examines how this motivation can be optimized in relation to Forest School pedagogy. Self-Determination Theory offers a broad perspective for motivational processes and will be used as a guide in this article to advance such a framework. Self-Determination Theory proposes that well-being, which has been identified as an aim of Forest School, is promoted through the support of three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness. In this conceptual article, we make links between Forest School pedagogical practices and Self-Determination Theory, mainly focusing on the support of children's basic psychological needs. Furthermore, we make suggestions for ways in which to enhance practice through explicit links with need-supportive teaching practices, as these are identified in the Self-Determination Theory literature.

This meta-synthesis aimed to explore adolescents' accounts of the experience of school belonging, and to promote their understanding of this experience in order to inform policy and practice. A meta-ethnographic methodology was used; this involved a process of reciprocal translation and subsequent synthesis of eight qualitative studies. The synthesis generated four main concepts: (1) school belonging and intersubjectivity; (2) school belonging and knowledge, understanding and acceptance of individual identity; (3) school belonging and experiences of in-group membership and (4) school belonging and safety/security. The synthesis of translation generated the higher-order concept of school belonging as feeling safe to be yourself in and through relationships with others in the school setting'. This concept considers the experience of school belonging for adolescents as a foundational prerequisite of academic engagement and achievement. The implications of these findings for education, social care and mental health practitioners and policymakers are discussed.																			1367-6261	1469-9680					2018	21	10					1411	1425		10.1080/13676261.2018.1477125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13676261.2018.1477125													WOS:000445257900008

However, labour mobility is not good per se for local firms. There is increasing evidence that labour recruited from skill-related industries has a positive effect on plant performance, in contrast to intra-industry labour recruits. However, little is known about which types of labour are recruited in different stages of the evolution of an industry, and whether that matters for plant performance. This paper attempts to fill these gaps in the literature using linked employee-employer data at the plant level for manufacturing and services industries in the Netherlands for the period 2001-2009. Our study focuses on the effects of different types of labour recruits on the survival of new plants. We show that the effects of labour recruits from the same industry and from skill-related and unrelated industries on plant survival vary between different stages of the evolution of an industry. We also find that inter-regional labour flows do not affect new plant survival.

However, such symmetric group behavior translates into significantly tighter equilibrium convergence only for Canadian females.

Balassa's approach compares a country's export of a given product with what would be expected from a benchmark based on the total volumes of countries and product flows. Based on results in the literature, we show that implementing Balassa's idea leads to conditions for estimating parameters conflicting with the information content of the model itself. Moreover, Balassa's approach does not implement any statistical validation. Hence, we propose an alternative procedure to overcome such a limitation, based upon the framework of entropy maximization and implementing a proper test of hypothesis: the 'key products' of a country are, now, the ones whose production is significantly larger than expected, under a null-model constraining the same amount of information defining Balassa's approach. What we found is that country diversification is always observed, regardless of the strictness of the validation procedure. Besides, the ranking of countries' fitnesses is only partially affected by the details of the validation scheme employed for the analysis while large differences are found to affect the rankings of product complexities. The routine for implementing the entropy-based filtering procedures employed here is freely available through the official Python Package Index PyPI.

To address our aim, we use the concept of product proximity and product space and, bortowing from the results of recent studies on complexity economics, we advance that the green products with the highest potential for growth among all green products in a given country are those being in close proximity to the products a country produces with high Relative Comparative Advantage (RCA). We test this hypothesis performing a regression analysis. We build the product space for 141 different countries for the years between 2005 and 2013 and for each country we compute the maximum proximity of each green product to the products with high RCA (i.e., the proximity of the product source of competitive advantage closest to the green product considered). Results confirm that green products with high maximum proximity to the products with high RCA had the highest growth. So doing, we contribute to the literature by providing a new application of the product space as a policy making tool for green development. We also provide several applications of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The participants were 183 female teachers and trainees, 93 from Osnabruck, Germany, representing an urban Western context, which can be characterized by a primary cultural orientation toward psychological autonomy and a constructivist pedagogical approach; and 90 Cameroonian teachers, representing a rural non-Western context, which can be characterized by a primary cultural emphasis on hierarchical relatedness and a didactic approach of formal apprenticeship. The teachers answered questionnaires about their general socialization goals, professional educational goals, and preferred behavioral strategies. Overall, the different cultural orientations and pedagogical approaches were embodied in teachers' general goals and preferred strategies. The German early child care teachers emphasized the value of psychological autonomy and child-centered methods most, whereas the Cameroonian teachers focused on hierarchical-relational socialization goals and apprenticeship-based teaching methods. However, results also showed discrepancies between general and professional goals of early child care teachers of the same cultural context, as well as differences with respect to teachers' work experience, indicating further impact factors on early child care teachers' goals besides the own cultural belief system.																			0256-8543	2150-2641					2014	28	2					203	220		10.1080/02568543.2014.884029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02568543.2014.884029													WOS:000210682300004

Students' motivation for learning, self-efficacy for learning and regulation, feeling of relatedness to peers, and individual repertoire of metacognitive regulation skills are included. SSMR was analysed through systematic observation of video recorded tutoring sessions (22.5 hours). The study involved 73 students, who further completed questionnaires and a think-aloud task. Multilevel models were run to investigate the relation between individual learner characteristics and students' involvement in SSMR. The results revealed that only students' adoption of metacognitive regulation during individual learning and their self-efficacy for regulation are significant correlates of their engagement in SSMR.

But the direct construction of Domain ontology manually is labor intensive and time consuming, while auto-generated Domain-specific Lexical Repository can be used to build domain ontology as an indispensable component. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to build domain-specific lexical repository making use of the dump service of Chinese Wikipedia. The main idea is that only concepts strongly semantic-related to the multi roots we choose are incorporate into the repository. First we use the dump service for all pages(zhwiki-all-pages.xml) of Chinese Wikipedia to generate a graph of all Wikipedia concepts, we call it pre-stage. Then we enter stage one by selecting three top-level nodes as roots, traversing the graph generated in the pre-stage using BFS-like algorithm to form spanning trees and computing rough domain relatedness of these nodes at the same time. Finally, in stage two we use the novel Modified Explicit Semantic Analysis method combined with the results we got in stage one to compute the ultimate domain relatedness. The experimental results shows that our method could get a high-quality domain-specific lexical repository.																			2352-5398		978-94-62520-82-0				2015	30						1097	1104																WOS:000359443000231

While the role of the factors of production-capital and labor-is well understood, the mechanisms that underpin Total Factor Productivity (TFP) are not fully determined. A number of heterogeneous studies point to the creation and transmission of knowledge, factor supply, and economic integration as key aspects; yet a need for a systematic and unifying framework still exists. Both capital and labor are embedded into a complex network structure through global supply chains and international migration, and it has been shown that the structure of global trade plays an important role in economic growth. Additionally, recent research has established a link between types of social capital and different network centralities. In this paper we explore the role of these measures of social capital as drivers of the TFP. By leveraging the EORA Multi Regional Input Output and the UN International Migration databases we build the complex network representation for capital and labor respectively. We compile a panel data set covering 155 economies and 26 years. Our results indicate that social capital in the factors of production network significantly drives economic output through TFP.

Recently, specific aspects of the higher education course context have been theoretically linked to procrastination. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to integrate specific course characteristics (e.g., feedback structure, social norms, clarity of assignments), examine in which way they relate to procrastination, and if this relation can be explained by the satisfaction of basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. We conducted a multivariate two-level study with a sample of 90 courses with 1,809 students from different faculties and semesters. Results imply that academic procrastination is associated with specific course characteristics to a considerable degree. Basic need satisfaction was negatively related to academic procrastination at a medium level on both, the individual student level as well as the course level. Moreover, basic need satisfaction explained the relations between specific course characteristics and procrastination.																			0144-3410	1469-5820				APR 21	2023	43	4					263	283		10.1080/01443410.2023.2219873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2023.2219873		JUN 2023											WOS:001011785800001

In the current context, the drivers of material and resource efficiency in the Nordic region are examined by utilizing requisite empirical approaches over the period 1995-2020. The investigation revealed that economic activities which are characterized by Gross domestic product (GDP) alongside the growth of urban population and utilization of oil energy are all detrimental to the region's resource efficiency. It implies that material utilization efficiency cannot be optimized with the current trend of the region's GDP, urban population growth and the use of dirty energy. Contrarily, the findings, further revealed that alternative energy utilization vis-`a-vis renewables are key indicators to spur material and resource efficiency in the region, thus throwing more support for the region's unavoidable energy transition goal. These highlighted results alongside the Granger causality inference offer sustainable development measures that are specifically motivated through the improvement of efficient and optimization of output.

Market reactions to acquisition announcements: The importance of signaling 'why' and 'where'	LONG RANGE PLANNING												Acquisitions are risky events but not all acquisitions involve the same levels of risk. We suggest that the announced acquisition motive - the 'why' of the acquisition - is an important risk signal. We categorize acquisition motives and distinguish between acquisitions with 'pure explore' and 'pure exploit' motives. Recognizing that most acquisitions have multiple motives, we identify acquisitions with 'ambidextrous' motives - that is different combinations of explorative and exploitative motives - too. Then, building on recent contributions to signaling theory, we argue that the 'why' will matter more, if the 'where' pertains to a high-risk setting. We measure this using target-to-acquirer industry relatedness. We find that the market reacts more positively to pure acquisitions, aimed at exploration or exploitation, compared to ambidextrous acquisitions. We show that the market reacts more positively to ambidextrous acquisitions orientated towards exploitation than ambidextrous acquisitions orientated toward exploration. Finally, we find that relatedness moderates this relationship, in that the market is more willing to tolerate exploration in a related industry. Our core contribution is to the literatures on acquisition motives and ambidexterity. We provide new insights into the incidence of specific motives, the ways in which they are mixed, and the market's reaction to their announcement. In addition, we contribute to the emerging literature that takes on behavioral perspective of market reactions by showing that the 'why' and 'where' of an acquisition matter.

The influences affecting the number of taxa found in urban areas and their phylogenetic diversity remains unclear. Both native and exotic (or imported) plant species can be found in urbanized areas: some grow spontaneously, and some are cultivated. These groups likely have different drivers: cultivated species diversity may be dependent on city wealth and the nature and extent of green space within those urban areas. In contrast, spontaneous species diversity may be more closely related to the constraints of climate. In this study, we analyzed the drivers of plant taxonomic richness and phylogenetic diversity of five groups (native-spontaneous, native-cultivated, exotic-spontaneous, exotic-cultivated and all) across 18 different cities in China that spanned different climate zones and socioeconomic status. We used both fieldwork and existing literature in our study. We constructed general linear models to assess whether the number of taxa and the phylogenetic diversity of plant life in each of the five studied groups could be related to any of two biophysical variable Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) and Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP as well as two socioeconomic variables, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Urban Greening Percentage (UGP). We identified 5163 plant species (229 families and 1730 genera) in the combined final plant species list from the 18 Chinese cities. The composition of all plant species was positively correlated (p < 0.01) with both MAP and MAT. Very few diversity metrics seemed to be related to the environmental factors tested, but the patterns were consistent with expectations. The Net Relatedness Index (NTI) of native cultivated species was negatively related to socioeconomic variable UGP (greater overdispersion with greater UGP), whereas the family richness and phylogenetic overdispersion of urban spontaneous plant species were positively related to the climate variable MAT. These findings might indicate long-term urban legacy effects over the course of centuries as have been observed in other world regions having a long history of urbanization.

J	Asgarova, V; Tsang, KK				Asgarova, Vafa; Tsang, Kwok Kuen			Students' self-determination in Azerbaijan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT												Purpose It has been suggested that social impacts on young people are stronger in collectivistic societies than in individualistic societies due to stronger social norms. Therefore, the satisfaction of psychological needs might be more challenging for students in collectivistic societies. As Azerbaijani society is collectivistic, the purpose of this study was to explore the ways in which the need for the self-determination of Azerbaijani master's students is met in relation to their social circles. Design/methodology/approach Forty-four Azerbaijani master's students were interviewed for this study, and their answers were analyzed from the perspective of basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness within self-determination theory (SDT). Findings The findings of the current study suggest that Azerbaijani students' social environment is not supportive of furthering higher education through achieving a master's degree, and in some cases, this negatively affects students' well-being. Families in Azerbaijan mainly view higher education as being employment focused due to experiences of employment insecurity in the country. Research limitations/implications The participants of the current study were from middle- and low-income families in Azerbaijan, as the interviewer obtained basic information on the educational and occupational situations of participants' families in addition to the interviewees' own states. Perhaps due to financial needs, it was mainly found that families valued making money over long-term self-development aspirations in their children. Reaching larger numbers of participants, future studies may purposefully sample individuals from higher-income families to reveal whether families with fewer financial concerns were more autonomy-supportive in the aspirations by young people to further their education or how the pattern of their support varied due to socioeconomic status. Practical implications It is hoped that the presented results may guide the relevant authorities in the regulation of the employment strategies of youth in Azerbaijan, as high levels of youth unemployment and massive shifts to self-employment and low-skilled occupations create few opportunities to realize self-development aspirations in Azerbaijan. More efficient policies should be implemented to improve recruitment to good-quality jobs and increase the value of skills and knowledge in employment. Social implications Interconnected cultural factors determine families' views of furthering education and affect how they satisfy the psychological needs of students in their education lives. It is anticipated that the present study will be useful for students mainly from developing countries in coping with their social environments in pursuing their self-development aspirations. Originality/value Unlike previous studies, the authors suggest that through "gained autonomy", Azerbaijani youth who comply with their elders when less experienced tend to gain control over their personal decisions by providing positive information about overseas experiences. The concept of "gained autonomy" also contributes to SDT in illustrating how members of collectivistic societies can attempt to satisfy their basic psychological needs.

J	Tian, XY; Wang, YT; Wang, S; Zhao, Y; Zhao, YZ				Tian, Xinyuan; Wang, Yiting; Wang, Selena; Zhao, Yi; Zhao, Yize			Bayesian mixed model inference for genetic association under related samples with brain network phenotype	BIOSTATISTICS												Genetic association studies for brain connectivity phenotypes have gained prominence due to advances in noninvasive imaging techniques and quantitative genetics. Brain connectivity traits, characterized by network configurations and unique biological structures, present distinct challenges compared to other quantitative phenotypes. Furthermore, the presence of sample relatedness in the most imaging genetics studies limits the feasibility of adopting existing network-response modeling. In this article, we fill this gap by proposing a Bayesian network-response mixed-effect model that considers a network-variate phenotype and incorporates population structures including pedigrees and unknown sample relatedness. To accommodate the inherent topological architecture associated with the genetic contributions to the phenotype, we model the effect components via a set of effect network configurations and impose an inter-network sparsity and intra-network shrinkage to dissect the phenotypic network configurations affected by the risk genetic variant. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is further developed to facilitate uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the performance of our model through extensive simulations. By further applying the method to study, the genetic bases for brain structural connectivity using data from the Human Connectome Project with excessive family structures, we obtain plausible and interpretable results. Beyond brain connectivity genetic studies, our proposed model also provides a general linear mixed-effect regression framework for network-variate outcomes.					wang, yiting/JFS-6231-2023														1465-4644	1468-4357				2024 MAR 17	2024										10.1093/biostatistics/kxae008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxae008		MAR 2024						38494649					WOS:001186123300001

Basic research generates ideas, which firms take up in applied research to develop new varieties. A country's specialization in international trade thus determines which ideas can be commercialized domestically. We demonstrate that the equilibrium is consistent with key empirical patterns. We then show that national investments may cause inefficiencies along three dimensions: (1) There is typically too little total investment in basic research. (2) Basic research is too heavily concentrated in industrialized countries. (3) Basic research may not be sufficiently directed to support innovation in complex, high-tech industries. These inefficiencies can rationalize international coordination of basic research investments or support policies such as the Bayh-Dole Act.

J	Hamper, J; Nash, C				Hamper, Josie; Nash, Catherine			Bonding work: Spacing relations through pregnancy apps	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS												Smartphone pregnancy apps, which enable their users to track a pregnancy week by week and offer advice to coincide with each stage, have transformed the spaces and times in which pregnancy information can be accessed. In this paper we draw on recent geographical work on the family, relatedness, and digitally mediated forms of intimacy, to explore how these apps figure in the embodied, emotional, and relational geographies of pregnancy. We present an analysis of visual material from pregnancy apps and interviews with women in the UK who have used them, to examine how these apps are marketed as a means to facilitate the "bonding work" of forming a close relationship with the future baby through visual images of foetal development, and related to this, how they mobilise ideas of biologically naturalised and socially normative maternal bonding. For users, however, existing and future relationships with prospective fathers and grandparents, as well as the expected baby, are practised in the spaces of everyday life through the strategic and selective sharing of pregnancy information. Our attention to the spatialities and practices of making intergenerational and parental relationships shows how users of apps respond to ideas of physical closeness in pregnancy and how this intersects with ideas of relational closeness and connection as both natural and achieved through bonding work. Women's engagements with pregnancy apps can therefore provide important insights both into the contemporary making of intimate relationships through digital technologies and geographies of parenting and pregnancy.

RESEARCH POLICY												Do scientific capabilities in regions translate into technological leadership? This is one of the most pressing questions in academic and policy circles. This paper analyzes the matching of scientific and technological capabilities of 285 European regions. We build on patent and publication records to identify regions that lie both at the scientific and technological frontiers (strongholds), that are pure scientific leaders, pure technological leaders, or just followers in 18 domains. Our regional diversification model shows that local scientific capabilities in a domain are a strong predictor of the development of new technologies in that domain in regions. This finding is particularly relevant for the Smart Specialization policy because it implies that the analysis of domain-specific scientific knowledge can be a powerful tool to identify new diversification opportunities in regions.																			0048-7333	1873-7625				DEC	2022	51	10							104594	10.1016/j.respol.2022.104594	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2022.104594		JUL 2022											WOS:000830915500002

The moderating roles of technological relatedness and product-market competition	RESEARCH POLICY												In studying the performance consequences of research and development (R&D) alliances, one stream of research has concentrated on the acquisition of partners' technological knowledge whereas another has focused on firms' new product development outcomes. Bridging these two research streams, this study directly connects knowledge acquisition through R&D alliances to new product development and examines when R&D alliances enable firms to apply acquired technological knowledge in the product domain. Using longitudinal and multisource data on a sample of firms engaged in R&D alliances in the information technology industry, I find that knowledge acquisition is on average positively associated with firms' numbers of new products. However, I also find that knowledge acquisition is substantially more beneficial for new product development both when firms and their partners are active in similar technology domains and when they operate in distinct product markets.

To the best of our knowledge, the few studies that explicitly examine the relations among EEs' actors under-remark the linkages between Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and new ventures. We deem that this relation is important, especially for EEs located in countries characterized by an underdeveloped Venture Capital (VC) market, a limited number of large corporations and a massive presence of SMEs, often operating in traditional industries, which are the main engine of local and regional development. This study sets the stage for advancing our understanding of this under-explored relation to stimulate novel directions for academic research and practice-oriented conversations on EEs and, more generally, on regional development. To this end, first, we systematize the (limited) extant knowledge on the relation between SMEs and new ventures in EEs. Then, for the shake of relevance, we provide descriptive evidence of this relation in the context of Italian Industrial Districts (IIDs), a peculiar case of EEs, where Italian SMEs tend to agglomerate. Specifically, by using GIS techniques, we found evidence that Innovative Startups tend to locate within IIDs. Interestingly enough, no evidence supports the view that Innovative Startups operate in the same industry of specialization of the IID. Finally, the study presents a possible research agenda on the topic, which we hope can be of interest for both academics and policymakers.

It may thus affect regional industrial dynamics. By employing the industrial relatedness indicator, this article shows that regional industrial dynamics is path dependent in China. It further adopts several classical accessibility indicators to capture the network characteristics of transport infrastructure and the accessibility of Chinese cities in the HSR network. In response to the endogeneity issue, we design an instrumental variable based on historic transport network. Another econometric strategy is to include only two groups of cities in the sample: cities with existing HSR stations and cities with planned HSR stations. The empirical results suggest that high accessibility in the HSR network not only pushes forward new industry creation but also enables regions to be more pathbreaking and diversify into less related industries.

We introduce an unsupervised knowledge-source approach for word sense disambiguation using a bee colony optimization algorithm that is constructive in nature. Our algorithm, using WordNet, optimizes the search space by globally disambiguating a document by constructively determining the sense of a word using the previously disambiguated words. Heuristic methods for unsupervised word sense disambiguation mostly give less importance to the context words while determining the sense of the target word. In this paper, we put more emphasis on the context and the part of speech of a word while determining its correct sense. We make use of a modified simplified Lesk algorithm as a relatedness measure. Our approach is then compared with recent unsupervised heuristics such as ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing, and shows promising results. We finally introduce a voting strategy to our algorithm that ends up further improving our results.																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-75477-2; 978-3-319-75476-5				2018	9623		I				479	495		10.1007/978-3-319-75477-2_34	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75477-2_34													WOS:000540380100034

J	Carreira, JM; Ozaki, K; Maeda, T				Carreira, Junko Matsuzaki; Ozaki, Koken; Maeda, Tadahiko			Motivational model of English learning among elementary school students in Japan	SYSTEM												Assessing the motivational responses of 239 elementary school students among 271 students (141 boys, 130 girls) comprising 63 third (8-9 years old), 62 fourth (9-10 years old), 75 fifth (10-11 years old), and 71 sixth (11-12 years old) grade students in one public elementary school in Tokyo, Japan, this study examined a motivational model of English learning, based on self-determination theory (SDT). This study also explored how developmental differences would appear in the motivational model. Results support the notion that perceived teachers' autonomy support positively predicts intrinsic motivation through students' perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, although some evidence exists for partial mediation. Regarding age differences, the path from students' perceptions of competence to intrinsic motivation showed higher coefficients for students of higher grades than for students of middle grades; the path from perceived teachers' autonomy support to intrinsic motivation showed higher coefficients for students of middle grades than for students of higher grades.

To these ends, we used a quasi-experimental research design: The experimental group (n=46) participated in the two-week intervention during a class subject focusing on character and citizenship education (CCE) while the wait-list control group (n=57) went on with regular CCE activities. All participants completed a questionnaire a week before and a month after the implementation of the SOGI and control activities. The changes in relatedness scores were statistically significant in relation to parents and peers, but not in relation to teachers. In particular, the experimental group generally maintained the quality of their relationship with their parents and peers while the control group reported a decline in these relationship domains. The change in gratitude levels did not differ significantly between the experimental group and control group, but the effect size associated with the mean gratitude change of the experimental group was found to be larger than that of the control group and comparable to what is commonly reported in other published gratitude intervention studies. The students' feedback reveals the social, cognitive and affective benefits of the SOGI.

J	Long, JC				Long, Joanna C.			Diasporic Families: Cultures of Relatedness in Migration	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												Family is central to migration. It can be the reason and mechanism for movement, as well as a key context in which the effects of migration are felt. Recent work has demonstrated that families are not necessarily destroyed by migration but rather that migrants develop new ways to maintain a sense of family over distance. Focusing on the doing rather than the definition of family, this article explores the idiosyncratic cultures of relatedness through which people make family in diasporic contexts and the associated tension between what family is and should be. The article examines how family is deployed as both an enduring and elastic migration resource and adds to arguments that distance does not foreclose familial intimacy. It also questions the presumed correlation between proximity and intimacy, in which geographical and emotional closeness are conflated, and the making of family over larger distances is ignored. Drawing on in-depth interviews with Palestinians living in Britain, the article examines practices of making family through visiting relatives in different parts of the world, in conjunction with broader opinions and experiences of family. It explores how migration can reveal the tensions of geography and kinshiptensions between the perceived incontrovertibility of family relationships and the need to continually construct those relationships across space. I conclude that migration precipitates a reworking of family relationships and a reimagination of the very notion of family itself but that these new formations remain tied to conventional ideas of proper family as a spatially and temporally situated unit, with potentially painful implications for feelings of family relatedness. ??????????????????????, ????????????????????????, ?????????????, ??, ????????????????????????????, ???????, ????????????????????????, ?? ???? ? ?????? ???????????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????????????, ??????????????, ???????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????, ???????????????????????????????????????????????????, ????????????????????????????, ????????????, ???????????, ??????, ????????????????? ?? ????????, ????????????????????? La familia es un elemento central de la migracion. Asuntos familiares pueden ser la razon del movimiento y de los mecanismos involucrados, lo mismo que el contexto clave dentro del cual se sienten los efectos de la migracion. El trabajo reciente demuestra que las familias no necesariamente se destruyen por la migracion sino por el contrario que los migrantes desarrollan nuevas maneras de conservar y enaltecer el sentido de familia por encima de la distancia. Enfocando mas la definicion de familia que las acciones relacionadas, este articulo explora las culturas idiosincraticas de pertenencia familiar con las cuales la gente define el ambito familiar en contextos diasporicos y la tension asociada entre lo que la familia es y lo que deberia ser. El articulo examina como la familia es desplegada como recurso de migracion perdurable y elastico, contribuyendo a la argumentacion de que la distancia no obstaculiza la fortaleza familiar. Cuestiona tambien la supuesta correlacion entre proximidad e intimidad, donde la cercania geografica y la emocional se fusionan, y la construccion de familia sobre distancias mas grandes es ignorada. Con base en entrevistas de profundidad con palestinos residentes en Gran Bretana, el articulo examina las practicas para construir familia por medio de familiares visitantes en diferentes partes del mundo, en conjuncion con opiniones mas amplias y experiencias familiares. El articulo explora como la migracion puede sacar a flote las tensiones entre geografia y parentescotensiones entre el caracter incontrovertible percibido de las relaciones familiares y la necesidad de edificar continuamente esas relaciones a traves del espacio. Concluyo que la migracion precipita el replanteamiento de las relaciones familiares y una re-imaginacion de la propia nocion de familia, pero que estas nuevas formaciones se mantienen atadas a ideas convencionales de la propia familia, como una unidad situada espacial y temporalmente con implicaciones potencialmente penosas en lo que al sentimiento de parentesco se refiere.																			0004-5608	1467-8306				MAR 4	2014	104	2			SI		243	252		10.1080/00045608.2013.857545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2013.857545													WOS:000333992900004

Interventions to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs in organizations: A systematic review with recommendations for research and practice	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY												Organizational research underpinned by self-determination theory (SDT) has grown substantially over the past decade. However, the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote support for basic psychological needs in organizations remains ill documented. We thus report the results of a qualitative systematic review and synthesis of SDT-informed studies of interventions to cultivate autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, and in turn, autonomous motivation in organizational contexts. Studies were included in the review if they evaluated the effect of interventions to develop autonomy-, competence-, or relatedness-supportive work climates or leader behaviours. A systematic search yielded ten eligible field studies for inclusion: three randomized-controlled trials and seven non-randomized intervention studies (combined N = 2,337). Seven studies yielded mostly favourable effects, two yielded mixed effects, and one study showed no evidence of change post-intervention. Substantial heterogeneity in intervention format and delivery existed across studies. Studies pointed towards possible moderators of effectiveness. Interventions were more effective at spawning change at the proximal (leader) level than at the distal (subordinate) level, though few studies tracked employees over time to comprehensively evaluate long-term transfer. Bias assessments showed that risk of bias was moderate or high across studies. We discuss overall implications of the review and suggest several recommendations for future intervention research and practice. Practitioner points Interventions to help leaders to support subordinates' basic psychological needs are effective in creating change in leader behaviour. Intervention effects for subordinate outcomes are smaller and may take time to materialize. Interventions tend to be more effective if they are aligned with organizational strategic needs, proactively consider unique work contexts, are endorsed by senior levels of management, and give preference to pedagogy that aligns with basic needs.

We present a theoretical framework and an empirical analysis based upon a dataset composed of worldwide R&D-intensive firms. In order to identify the technological proximity between the firms, we construct an original Mahalanobis environmental industry weight matrix, based on the construction of technological vectors for each firm, with European ecological patents distributed across more technology classes. Opportune econometric techniques that deal with the firms' unobserved heterogeneity and the weak exogeneity of the explanatory variables are implemented. The findings show significant spillover effects on the productivity and environmental performance of the firms.

Until recently, the literature had depicted such platforms primarily as a tool for enabling local knowledge recombination - and not for anchoring non-local knowledge. In many regions, however, 'smart specialisation strategies' for modernising and transforming industrial structures are difficult to implement without transplantation of non-local knowledge. This paper explores innovation platforms as a tool for anchoring non-local knowledge. We elaborate on recent Chinese experiences by studying diversification-oriented regional innovation policy in Guangdong province. We employ an embedded single-case study design, involving a regionally typical diversification strategy, which we substantiate by tracing platform development with two non-local actors, a university and a technology firm. The paper reveals that non-local actors can play an important role in unlocking regional industrial development potential, especially if platforms enable these actors to relate to local industry by performing desired intermediary functions.

The coach may have an important role to play in shaping the motivational climate to encourage and retain participants in adventure sport. The purpose of this study was to provide an in-depth examination of the coach-created motivational climate in noncompetition focused adult adventure sport by adopting a multiple methods approach. The study was grounded in a multidimensional theoretical perspective that combines achievement goal theory and self-determination theory. Questionnaires, interviews, and observations of coaching sessions were employed to assess coaches' (N = 6), participants' (N = 25), and observers' perspectives on the empowering and disempowering nature and features of coaching sessions. Analysis of the data demonstrated consistent views that the coaches created a strongly empowering and only weakly disempowering climate. Insight was gained about why and how coaches created this climate, as well as the challenges they experienced in maintaining an empowering climate for adults in adventure sport contexts. The place of structure, control, relatedness support, and coaches' philosophies are discussed.

We go beyond "constraints-based" explanations of spousal influence and focus on the degree to which the spouse has aspirations for the focal employee's career - referred to as spousal career aspirations. Using a dyadic study design, we tested a model that specifies the influence of both partners' career salience and materialism on an employee's motivation for a particular career path: as manager or technical specialist. According to survey responses from a matched sample of 207 employees and their spouses, the spouse's career salience and materialism (the latter only for women) were associated with higher levels of spousal career aspirations. In turn, those employees whose spouses aspired for them to have a career were less motivated to obtain a specialist position. Employees' own career salience was positively associated with their motivation for a managerial position and, in combination with high levels of spousal career aspirations, pulled employees away from a career on the technical ladder. Our results shed light on the family-relatedness of career decisions and have notable implications for dual ladder organizations.

So, the motive and main concern of automatic text classifiers is to segregate the relevant documents and irrelevant documents. The automated text classifier organizes the clustered data automatically. In this paper, a method for automatically classifying text has been implemented, by pre-processing the data in hand and selecting the necessary features and then classifying the data with ontology. Here, two techniques for pre-processing have been used that are stop words removal and stemming. In this paper, when the words are stemmed, it's necessary to remove the noise from the data, which has been implemented here using feature selection technique known as univariate selection and using tools named as PyDotPlus and Graphviz, followed by ontology-based classification of documents which can be implemented in future.

The sample consisted of 448 students (207 males and 241 females; Mage = 10.58 years, SD = 0.54) from elementary school in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, Mexico. The results obtained through structural equation modeling revealed that task presentation was positively and significantly associated with the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, and this, in turn, was similarly associated with intentions to be physically active. In conclusion, the quality with which the teacher communicates the learning tasks plays a relevant role in students' perception of themselves as autonomous, competent and related, as well as in their future desires to engage in physical activity.																			2386-8333					JAN	2024	10	1					47	70		10.17979/sportis.2024.10.1.9972	http://dx.doi.org/10.17979/sportis.2024.10.1.9972													WOS:001134666300002

The spatiality of belonging and identity - but also of trauma and violence - are central concerns for the people involved and to the operations of their cultural, political, and legal practice. Yet surprisingly, cultural geographers have not yet developed a conceptualization of transnational adoption that theorizes it as a constitutive aspect of geographies of migration, domestic geographies, and geography of childhood. In this issue we seek to set out an agenda for the cultural and political geographies of transnational adoption. We do so by discussing three interrelated themes: the adoption-migration nexus, geographies of relatedness, and the biopolitics of mobility.

J	Chou, WY; Hung, SH				Chou, Wan-Yu; Hung, Shih-Han			Cumulative Frequency of Nature Dose: How Continuous and Regular Forest Walking Improves Nature Relatedness, Restorativeness, and Learning Engagement in College Students	SUSTAINABILITY												Forest is a natural resource that provides natural walking as a popular leisure activity for urban residents. From the perspective of "dose of nature ", continuous contact with natural environments and engagement in natural activities can gradually promote positive health benefits. This study aims to explore the "cumulative frequency of nature dose " through regular forest walking. Ten college students were recruited to walk once a week for 30 min in the campus forest. Eight weeks of forest walking experiences were collected by administering questionnaires on nature relatedness, mental health, restorativeness, and learning engagement before the first walk, as well as after the fourth and the eighth walks. The findings of this study revealed that regular forest activities can induce accumulated natural benefits. By taking at least 30 min of forest walks once a week continuously for eight weeks, the subjects improved their mental health, increased learning engagement in school, gained more attention recovery and reflection experiences, and re-established a relationship with nature. In addition, different doses of natural benefits were observed for different cumulative processes.

Connection to nature and time spent in gardens predicts social cohesion	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												A person's health and wellbeing are contingent on the amount of social support that they receive. Similarly, experiencing nature has been shown to improve people's health and wellbeing. However, we do not know how relationships between social cohesion, nature experiences and nature connection could interrelate and vary across different types of urban green spaces, and in non-Westernised cultures. We conducted a study on 1249 residents in Singapore, a tropical city-state, and measured three dimensions of social cohesion (i.e. general social cohesion; trust and sense of community; and social interactions), various types of nature experiences (i.e. amount of green space around one's residence; frequency and duration of urban green space visits; frequency and duration of visits to gardens), and three dimensions of one's connection to nature: self-identity with nature, desire to experience nature, and environmental concern (using the nature relatedness scale). We found that people who strongly identify with nature, who enjoy being in nature, and who had more frequent gardens visits were more likely to have a stronger sense of social cohesion across two dimensions. However, those with stronger environmental concern reported an overall weaker sense of social cohesion, possibly due to the perception that society's contributions to conserve environmental problems was insufficient. Further, people who gardened more frequently were also more likely to visit green spaces, self-identify with nature and exhibit a stronger desire to experience nature. We propose that strategies targeted at encouraging people to engage in nature-related, collaborative activities at the local community level, such as spending time in local gardens, will increase urban residents' daily nature experiences and its associated benefits such as improving social cohesion.

Filling a gap about the role of global research and development (R&D) networks, we maintain that by patenting in pivotal GNRD industries, regions become more exposed to global knowledge and increase their capacity to diversify also in technologies less cognitively related to pre-existing ones. Using novel GNRD data, we test this using a panel (2004-19) of NUTS-2 regions for the EU-13. GNRD regional exposure positively correlates with technological diversification, mainly at the intensive margin. A higher exposure makes technological diversification less related to existing technologies, though the relationship is non-linear.

There is yet little focus in S3 policy on the role of interregional linkages. This study on 292 NUTS-2 regions in Europe finds that interregional linkages have a positive effect on the probability of regions to diversify, especially in peripheral regions. What matters is not being connected to other regions per se, but being connected to regions that provide complementary capabilities. Finally, we propose a new indicator that enables regions to identify other regions as strategic partners in their S3 policy, depending on the presence of complementary capabilities in other regions.

J.; Jimenez-Loaisa, Alejandro			The frustration of novelty and basic psychological needs as predictors of maladaptive outcomes in physical education	PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY												BackgroundThe need for novelty has been recently proposed as a candidate need within basic psychological needs theory (BPNT). In physical education (PE), research has shown that meeting students' need for novelty is often positively associated with enhanced (and negatively associated with impaired) pupils' well-being. Frustrating students' novelty has also been negatively related to achieving multiple positive outcomes in PE. However, no research has explored whether frustration of novelty is positively associated with maladaptive consequences for pupils in this educational context, which is a necessary criterion to be included within BPNT.PurposeIn this correlational study, we aimed to determine whether frustration of novelty was associated with up to 10 maladaptive outcomes in a similar way as the frustration of the three basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness). The maladaptive outcomes analyzed were amotivation, boredom, negative affect, entity beliefs, fear of failure, worry, concentration disruption, somatic and social physique anxiety, and oppositional defiance.Research designCross-sectional study.MethodsA total of 533 students (M-age = 14.47, SD = 1.34; 56.66% female) from eight secondary schools completed online questionnaires assessing their basic psychological needs frustration, novelty frustration and diverse maladaptive outcomes in PE. Pearson's correlations and hierarchical regression analyses controlling by sex, age, and race, were calculated to test the associations among these variables.FindingsThe correlation coefficients for novelty frustration were like those found for the three basic psychological needs concerning maladaptive outcomes in PE students. Particularly, hierarchical regression analyses showed that frustrating novelty in PE predicted amotivation (beta = .11, p = .039), boredom (beta = .23, p < .001), entity beliefs (beta = .12, p = .039), and concentration disruption (beta = .12, p = .049).ConclusionsResults showed that novelty frustration was positively related to experiencing some negative consequences in PE, which is an important criterion within BPNT. Future training programs aimed at promoting optimal (and preventing detrimental) motivational styles in PE teachers could use these results to optimize students' PE experiences.

Since their systems usually serve a lot of clients, a diversity of the system usage may exist. The evolution of a service-oriented system is facilitated if the offered services are specific for each group of clients. However, the state-of-the-art service-identification approaches do not consider the system usage. Thus, we propose an online process that dynamically re-identifies services by the arrival of new method traces of the system usage. The preliminary evaluation of our process on real-world case-studies shows high effectiveness on identifying usage-aware services.

J	Li, YC				Li, Yingcheng			Path-breaking industrial development reduces carbon emissions: Evidence from Chinese Provinces, 1999-2011	ENERGY POLICY												The secondary industry has been a major contributor to energy consumption and carbon emissions, whereas relatively few studies have empirically analyzed how different evolution patterns of the secondary industry could affect carbon emissions. By taking China as a case study, this paper investigates the relationship between carbon emissions and path-breaking industrial development at the provincial level. Here the development of a province's secondary industry is considered more path-breaking if the newly-developed subsectors of the secondary industry are less related with its existing subsectors. Drawing upon the concept of industrial relatedness and finegrained data on the development of 183 three-digit and 505 four-digit subsectors of China's secondary industry, this paper measures the path-breaking development level of the secondary industry of 30 Chinese provinces between 1999 and 2011. The empirical results show that path-breaking development of the secondary industry reduces carbon emissions of Chinese provinces. Moreover, the impact of path-breaking industrial development is much stronger for provinces that have higher output of energy-intensive industries. The results suggest that, rather than curbing the growth of the secondary industry, promoting path-breaking industrial development can be an alternative and effective way to reduce carbon emissions especially for provinces that rely heavily on the secondary industry.					li, yingcheng/ADI-7189-2022	li, yingcheng/0000-0002-0894-6461													0301-4215	1873-6777				AUG	2022	167								113046	10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113046		JUN 2022											WOS:000814625000007

Using descriptive coding and thematic analysis of focus group data, we explore adolescents' perceptions of the bridges that foster and the barriers that inhibit supportive relationships with teachers, and the boundary expectations that function as both.

Participants were 445 (girls 256, boys 189) Finnish schoolchildren (M-age = 11.26 +/- 0.32 years). Need satisfaction self-reports and accelerometer-based MVPA data were collected in 17 comprehensive schools over four assessment phases. Four latent profiles based on the need satisfaction trends over time were found: Profiles with Large Decrease, Small Decrease, Small Increase, and Large Increase. The children with the most prominent need satisfaction decreases showed a significant decline in out-of-school MVPA. All the children, irrespective of their need satisfaction profile, exhibited similar patterns of MVPA in PE over the 3-year follow-up. Developing need satisfactions and out-of-school MVPA of the children with the greatest need satisfaction decreases may require enhancements in need-supportive PE activities.

The Product Space (PS) is a tool that supports the analysis of countries' productive structures and the identification of promising routes for future development. The PS and associated complexity indices highlight the relationship between the capabilities of countries and the successful export of complex products. The Input-Output Product Space (IO-PS) applies the PS and its associated metrics to a value chain. The results from the tool can inform industry-specific analyses by identifying avenues of development and quantifying their potential impact. Despite the utility of these approaches, the open-source packages that support PS-related analyses and their accessibility have left much to be desired. This has likely hampered the even greater uptake of these approaches. This article provides an overview of the most comprehensive implementations of the PS and IO-PS in Python, MATLAB and R to date. It identifies a number of incongruities between these packages and gaps in their application. Based on the shortcomings identified, a novel open-source Python package for the IO-PS that consolidates the disparate implementations is presented. It applies the IO-PS analysis approach to a chosen value chain and includes extended functionality compared to the original IO-PS in MATLAB and PS in Python and R. It incorporates trade data summation, analysis without a value chain and normalization toggling. The article makes a contribution by providing the first open-source Python IO-PS package and consolidating the existing implementations by explaining - and addressing - their differences.

J	Abualhaija, S; Zimmermann, KH				Abualhaija, Sallam; Zimmermann, Karl-Heinz			D-Bees: A novel method inspired by bee colony optimization for solving word sense disambiguation	SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION												Word sense disambiguation is an early problem in the field of computational linguistics, and is defined as identifying the sense (or senses) that most likely represents a word, or a sequence of words in a given context. Word sense disambiguation was recently addressed as a combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of senses that maximizes the semantic relatedness among the target words. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for solving the word sense disambiguation problem, namely D-Bees, that is inspired by the bee colony optimization meta-heuristic in which several artificial bee agents collaborate to solve the problem. The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a standard SemEval 2007 task 7 coarse-grained English all-words corpus and is compared to the genetic and simulated annealing algorithms as well as an ant colony algorithm. It will follow that the bee and ant colony optimization approaches perform on par achieving better results than the genetic and simulated annealing algorithms on the given dataset.

Previous studies have shown that fully developed morphological representations are abstract and independent of their semantic properties. However, little is known about the morphological representations of low SES adolescents. The current study examined whether the morphological knowledge of low SES adolescents is independent of semantic properties. To this end, seventy-three Hebrew-speaking 9th graders performed two morphological tasks in a within-subject design: the priming lexical judgement task that explored morphological processing, and the morphological analogies task that assessed morphological awareness. In each task, we manipulated the level of semantic relatedness between stimuli and target words and assessed participants' accuracy and response time. The results of the priming lexical judgement task revealed significant differences between high and low SES students in both accuracy and reaction times. Among high SES students' morphological priming accelerated word identification regardless of semantic information. In contrast, among low SES students, acceleration was observed only when primes and targets shared semantically related morphemes. A similar pattern of results was found in the morphological analogies task, suggesting that low SES students' morphological representations are still semantically dependent. These results support the role of environmental factors in low SES students' linguistic knowledge.

J	Groulx, M; Lewis, J; Lemieux, C; Dawson, J				Groulx, Mark; Lewis, John; Lemieux, Christopher; Dawson, Jackie			Place-based climate change adaptation: A critical case study of climate change messaging and collective action in Churchill, Manitoba	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Climate change adaptation frameworks often emphasize tangible community vulnerabilities, but typically fail to recognize that healthy, vibrant, and resilient communities are also based on many factors that are experiential in nature. In response to the continued undervaluation of such factors, scholars are adopting place identity and place attachment as a way to explore the risks of climate change in a more holistic manner. This study draws on Churchill, Manitoba's unique relationship with climate change to present an early examination of place-based climate change adaptation. Results from a community survey suggest that citizens' sensitivity to local climate impacts is associated most strongly with their connection to the social meanings that are embedded in the natural landscape. Results also indicate that this place driven sensitivity does not necessarily lead to an increase in actions to adapt to climate change. It is suggested that inaction in the face of climate change can persist, even when citizens' have a strong connection to place, particularly because dominant climate change communications fail to produce a socially salient message. By linking place-based adaptation research to an emerging value-based frame for climate adaptation, this study presents new pathways to help legitimize local values in climate change adaptation processes, and to create frames for communication that are more conducive to fostering collective action.

We collected data from 422 boys and girls aged 7 to 14 years residing in Izmir, Turkey. Results indicated that the expression of connective gratitude was common across all ages, and there was a decrease in the expression of concrete gratitude with an increase in age. There was no relationship between types of wishes and gratitude or wishes and spending preferences; however, girls expressed less concrete gratitude and fewer hedonistic wishes compared with boys. Saving and donating were the most common spending preferences, and with an increase in age, the tendency for spending money to buy things for oneself increased. These findings are discussed in relation to how cultural experiences may influence the development of gratitude in this population.

Regional diversification and intra-regional wage inequality in the Netherlands	REGIONAL STUDIES												The literature has shown that related diversification in more complex industries enhances economic growth in regions but also inter-regional inequality. However, it has drawn little attention to the relationship between industrial dynamics (i.e., the rise and fall of industries) and intra-regional wage inequality. This explorative study examines the relationship between industry dynamics and wage inequality in NUTS-3 regions in the Netherlands in the period 2010-2019. Our study shows that related diversification in less complex industries tends to reduce wage inequality within a region. This implies it remains a policy challenge to combine smart and inclusive growth in regions. Our study also showed that there is no significant relationship between the exit of industries and regional inequality, with one exception: unrelated low-complex exits tend to increase intra-regional wage inequality. Overall, these findings suggest that related diversification in less complex industries tends to bring benefits in terms of inclusive growth, while unrelated exits in less complex industries tend to do the opposite.																			0034-3404	1360-0591				2024 APR 4	2024										10.1080/00343404.2024.2319339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2024.2319339		APR 2024											WOS:001195434200001

AREA DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY												Recent evolutionary economic geography (EEG) studies have argued that regional diversification emerges as a path-dependent process, as a region often branches into related industries, whereas unrelated industries have a high probability of exiting the region. Based on a firm-level dataset of China's manufacturing industries during 1998-2008, this paper examines the entry and exit of four-digit industries at the prefectural level, and shows that Chinese regional industrial development is a path-dependent process that is also affected by industry characteristics and the institutional framework. The results imply that EEG would profit from incorporating insights on institutional change and industry characteristics in explanations of regional industrial evolution.

J	Riley, G				Riley, Gina			The role of self-determination theory and cognitive evaluation theory in home education	COGENT EDUCATION												This article explores the theories of Self-Determination, Cognitive Evaluation, and Intrinsic Motivation as it applies to home education. According to Self-Determination Theory, intrinsic motivation is innate. However, the maintenance and enhancement of intrinsic motivation depends upon the social and environmental conditions surrounding the individual. Deci and Ryan's Cognitive Evaluation Theory specifically addresses the social and environmental factors that facilitate versus undermine intrinsic motivation and points to three significant psychological needs that must be present in the individual in order to foster self-motivation. These needs are competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Because of curriculum and time constraints, intrinsic motivation may be difficult to facilitate within the traditional classroom. This loss of intrinsic motivation for learning prompts some parents to homeschool their children. One of the most impressive strengths of home education lies in the fact that in many cases, the entire process revolves around a child's intrinsic motivation to learn.																			2331-186X						2016	3								UNSP 1163651	10.1080/2331186X.2016.1163651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2016.1163651													WOS:000385753200001
J	Whittle, A				Whittle, Adam			Local and nonlocal knowledge typologies: technological complexity in the Irish knowledge space	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES												This paper advances a measure of knowledge complexity to analyse for Ireland whether more complex knowledge is generated by local or foreign firms. Information on assignees, technological structure and global ownership contained within a recently developed Irish patent database forms the basis for distinguishing between technologies developed by local and nonlocal firms. Thereafter, our knowledge complexity index uses a modified bipartite network to link these technologies to their country of origin, i.e. local or nonlocal. Our results indicate that the most complex technologies tend to be produced in a few diverse regions. Furthermore, the majority of complex knowledge is generated in technology classes where the share of foreign activity is greater than local firms.

REGIONAL STUDIES												New green activities in regions tend to build on regional capabilities. This paper makes a first attempt to test the impact of political support for environmental policy at the national and regional scales, besides regional capabilities, on the ability of 95 regions in seven European countries to diversify into new green technologies during the period 2000-12. Evidence is found that related capabilities rather than political support in a region are associated with green diversification of regions. However, while political support at the national scale tends to moderate the role of regional capabilities, political support at the regional scale strengthens it.

J	Kang, S; Pai, CK; Kim, D				Kang, Sangguk; Pai, Chen-Kuo; Kim, Donghan			The Role of Chronological Age, Health, and Basic Psychological Needs for Older Adults' Travel Intention	SUSTAINABILITY												This study examined how demographic information, chronological age, older adults' physical and mental health, and basic psychological needs affected travel intention. The survey samples were collected from 577 adults, all over 60 years of age. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses. First, demographic information with chronological age was used for primary analysis. The outcome indicated that chronological age was negatively associated with travel intention while all other demographic variables were not. Secondly, when physical and mental health condition variables were added, physical health positively affected travel intention while chronological age still negatively affected travel intention. Thirdly, psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) for travel were included in the final analysis. The outcome showed that all psychological needs variables had a significant impact on travel intention for those with a physical health condition. However, chronological age was not a significant factor in travel intention during this analysis. This study shows that chronological age is not always an important factor that affects older adults' travel intention when other health and psychological variables are considered. This study provides some practical implications and tips for travel industry managers who are targeting the aging population.																				2071-1050				DEC	2019	11	23							6864	10.3390/su11236864	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236864													WOS:000508186400336

General-Purpose Ontology Enrichment from the WWW	WEB-AGE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT	Lecture Notes in Computer Science				12th International Conference on Web-Age Information Management	SEP 14-16, 2011	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	WAIM, Microsoft Res Asia				Ontology enrichment is required when the knowledge captured by the ontology is out of date or unable to capture the specified user requirements in a specific domain. In this paper we present an automatic statistical/semantic framework for enriching general-purpose ontologies from the World Wide Web (WWW). Using the massive amount of information encoded in texts on the web as a corpus, missing background knowledge such as concepts, instances and relations can be discovered and exploited to enrich general-purpose ontologies. The benefits of our approach are: (i) enabling ontology enrichment with missing background knowledge, and thus, enabling the reuse of such knowledge in future. (ii) saving time and effort required to manually enrich and update the ontologies. Experimental results indicate that the techniques used to enrich ontologies are both effective and efficient.

J	Lindgren, S; Morris, K; Price, A				Lindgren, Samantha; Morris, Kristi; Price, Amanda			Designing environmental storylines to achieve the complementary aims of environmental and science education through science and engineering practices	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION												Environmental education is implemented in formal curricula in multiple ways, including K-12 science. In the United States, the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) has provided a lens for considering how the goals of environmental education and formal science education may overlap and complement one another. Potential synergies emerge from similarities between NGSS science and engineering practices and the skills of questioning, analysis, and interpretation in the NAAEE Guidelines for Excellence. In this study, middle school students were engaged in an environmental storyline unit that supported their abilities to ask questions, design and conduct investigations, and develop model-based explanations, practices consistent across both fields. Participating students demonstrated positive gains in nature relatedness environmental attitudes. This study provides evidence that curricular design around the practices of science and environmental education connects the goals of each and may be a promising approach to broadening access to effective environmental education experiences.

They also like to reproduce the phonological elements of languages following given models. This contribution focuses on the theoretical foundations of pedagogical material devised by the author, published recently and used in class. By using a holistic approach integrating all the senses, young children discover a diversity of languages through puppets, songs, dances, manual and cultural activities as well as metaphonological training procedures.

Integrated labour pools, the argument goes, will give rise to agglomeration economies and subsequent growth. Behind this logic lies the idea that access to complementary skills in neighbouring cities will yield benefits for firms. Yet, at what travel time radius is access to these skills beneficial? Can a better understanding of this inform our assessment of the likely economic impact of proposed transport investments and subsequent reductions in travel times? Here we develop a method to estimate this radius based on the relationship between industry employment growth in a city and the size of employment in 'skill-related' sectors. Assuming car or rail travel, we find that for Northern cities the radius is around 45 min while for the South it is around 110 min. Manufacturing peaks around 45 min for the whole UK, including both North and South. Services, however, peak around 110 min in the South but 70 min in the North. A comparison between the UK's Integrated Rail Plan and earlier proposals to invest in High Speed 2 rail and Northern rail connections uncovers lost opportunities for employment growth in Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. This study provides a road-map for the deployment of methods from Evolutionary Economic Geography, originally developed to predict regional and urban growth and diversification processes as a function of the local skill mix, to evaluate the potential gains from transport infrastructure schemes.																			0308-518X	1472-3409				OCT	2023	55	7					1690	1713		10.1177/0308518X231159108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308518X231159108		MAR 2023											WOS:000945243400001

The present study aimed to develop a new motivational teaching instrument and provide indication for the scale's validity and reliability of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) teachers' basic psychological need fulfillment in online teaching (BPNOT), using samples of Indonesian novice and experienced ESP teachers across genders. The author employed four different development stages of BPNOT's scale using four different independent samples of ESP teachers in Indonesian EFL context (total n = 566). The first developmental stage was designed to develop items for the scale and to establish structure of factorial design utilizing a multivariate statistics of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) test. The second scale development was continued to determine the item scale factorial structure using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm whether the construct was consistent or not. The third development stage estimated the test of invariance across gender and teaching experience. Finally, the last developmental stage aimed to revalidate the validity and reliability of the new scale over time.

We specifically focus on whether there are asymmetric spillover effects depending on the intermediary role of firms' technological relatedness, which we proxy by the use of external sources of knowledge. Using data on 5900 Spanish firms for the period 2004-2016, we find that spillover effects from intra-sector and upstream knowledge pools are-in general-positive, although with some differences depending on the measure of firm performance and on the moderating role of technological networking. Our results also suggest the presence of a "business stealing effect" in environments with a high proportion of knowledge-based gross added value. Furthermore, we find that spillover effects are asymmetric depending on the firm's size and intensity of R&D employment. Knowledge spillovers seem to play a more significant role in the case of SMEs than in large companies, and firms with high intensities of R&D employment benefit more from upstream spillovers and less from horizontal spillovers than firms with low intensities.

Recent workshops and papers on sexuality, intimate facets of the body and other sensitive topics show that intimacy in its widest sense and its impact on people's lives and well-being is relevant to the HCI community. In this paper, we draw on the results of an ongoing literature review on intimacy which shows that the concept is rarely defined, even though it has a variety of meanings. Nonetheless, as the parameters in which intimacy is explored are comparable in many instances, a predominant view prevails on what intimacy means. We share an imaginary abstract that breaks with these conventions and shows potential benefits of expanding the view on intimacy. This provocation therefore urges HCI researchers to rethink their idea of what intimacy is and offers directions of how to do so.																					978-1-4503-7987-8				2020							123	129		10.1145/3393914.3395889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3393914.3395889													WOS:000747587200021
J	Vallone, T; Elia, S; Greve, P				Vallone, Tommaso; Elia, Stefano; Greve, Peder			International environmental complexity and the demand for generalists and specialists in executive selection	GLOBAL STRATEGY JOURNAL												Research Summary This study investigates the selection of generalists and specialists as an organizational response to the complexity of firms' international operations. Drawing on the concept of executive job demands, we identify institutional ambiguity and economic sophistication as two distinct sources of country environmental complexity resulting from a firm's foreign investment and predict how they affect the selection of new executives at multinational firms. Our hypotheses associate institutional ambiguity and economic sophistication with the appointment of executives with generalist and specialist backgrounds, respectively. We also examine how the two sources of environmental complexity interact and test multiple alternative specifications to enhance our understanding of environmental complexity as a determinant of executive job demands in the context of international business. Our empirical analyses are performed on a sample of 436 executive appointments occurring in 132 UK-based manufacturing firms, observed between 2008 and 2018. Findings show general support for our main hypotheses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings as well as directions for future research. Managerial Summary This study suggests that companies operating across different international environments through their subsidiary operations will be exposed to distinct demands that vary according to the type of environmental complexity. Our results reveal that companies tend to appoint top managers with specialist backgrounds when their focus is on economically sophisticated environments, whereas top managers with generalist backgrounds tend to be preferred in institutionally ambiguous environments. Our findings enhance our understanding of the demand for executive generalists and specialists in the international business context by showing that top managers' backgrounds are matched with the prevailing type of complexity deriving from the international operations of the firm, thus, questioning the widely held notion that executive generalists are generally preferred over specialists. Our study has important implications for the composition of top management teams and the shaping of executive career paths at multinational firms.

A quasi-experimental design with pre-test-post-test measures was used. A total of 149 students (72 boys, 77 girls; 9-12 years old) from eight classes of a school in northern Spain (75 in 5th grade, 74 in 6th grade) participated. The data obtained are the result of the comparison between two eight-session educational interventions: one in the experimental group (n = 74), in which social distancing was maintained at all times, and another one in the control group (n = 75), where the same proposals were developed, but social distancing was not maintained. It was found that no variable was affected by the maintenance of social distancing and, in addition, the students' competence-satisfaction increased significantly only in the group that experienced it. Thus, this study found that, contrary to expectations, due to the "social" nature of the subject, the imposed distancing had no negative effects in the short term.

Optimizations for Computing Relatedness in Biomedical Heterogeneous Information Networks: SemNet 2.0	BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING												Literature-based discovery (LBD) summarizes information and generates insight from large text corpuses. The SemNet framework utilizes a large heterogeneous information network or "knowledge graph" of nodes and edges to compute relatedness and rank concepts pertinent to a user-specified target. SemNet provides a way to perform multi-factorial and multi-scalar analysis of complex disease etiology and therapeutic identification using the 33+ million articles in PubMed. The present work improves the efficacy and efficiency of LBD for end users by augmenting SemNet to create SemNet 2.0. A custom Python data structure replaced reliance on Neo4j to improve knowledge graph query times by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, two randomized algorithms were built to optimize the HeteSim metric calculation for computing metapath similarity. The unsupervised learning algorithm for rank aggregation (ULARA), which ranks concepts with respect to the user-specified target, was reconstructed using derived mathematical proofs of correctness and probabilistic performance guarantees for optimization. The upgraded ULARA is generalizable to other rank aggregation problems outside of SemNet. In summary, SemNet 2.0 is a comprehensive open-source software for significantly faster, more effective, and user-friendly means of automated biomedical LBD. An example case is performed to rank relationships between Alzheimer's disease and metabolic co-morbidities.

The final sample consisted of 40 Turkish migrant children, 56 German urban middle-class children, 47 German rural children, 61 Turkish urban middle-class children, and 21 Turkish rural children. The children of the five cultural milieus did not differ in age, gender distribution, or human figure drawing ability. Besides the drawings, the mothers' sociocultural orientation was assessed, as well as migrant mothers' involvement in the German and Turkish cultures. The results revealed similarities between Turkish migrant children's self- and family-depictions with those of children from their culture of origin, particularly in some categorical features such as gender-specific characteristics, torso type, and neighbors. On the other hand, however, the drawings differed from those of Turkish rural children in the size of the depicted self. These findings are in line with the specific ecocultural context and the cultural orientation of Turkish migrant families toward psychological autonomy and hierarchical relatedness. It can therefore be concluded that Turkish migrant children's drawings are influenced by both their culture of origin, probably mediated by their familial socialization, and their social experiences in Germany.

Focusing on patent data for four technologies at the core of I4.0 between 2000 and 2014, we provide evidence of their uneven distribution across NUTS-2 European regions. Our analysis confirms the role of regional absorptive capacity, cognitive and spatial proximity as drivers of I4.0 knowledge flows, but also indicates important variations among these technologies. Cumulated technological capabilities and spatial proximity exert a stronger effect on the diffusion of robots and 3D printing, whereas big data and the Internet of Things tend to be more spatially distributed.

J	Mombaers, T; Donche, V				Mombaers, Tine; Donche, Vincent			Hospital School Students' Academic Motivation and Support Needs: A Self-Determination Perspective	FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION												In contrast with the plethora of studies on the academic motivation of regular students in regular educational settings, this study aims to shed light on the motivation and educational support needs of chronically ill children in hospital schools. This in-depth qualitative study seeks to explore whether the expected motivational dimensions central in SDT research are present in this specific population and setting and if the expected relationships with 'needs' are present. In contrast with research on academic motivation and needs in common classrooms, research on hospital schools is very scarce. Using the theoretical framework of self-determination theory, we investigated the presence of different types of motivation linked with ABC. More specifically, we investigated students' motivational types linked with the educational support needs that they expect their hospital school teacher(s) to address. A purposive selected sample of six students with severe chronic or long-term illnesses from three different hospital schools in Flanders (Belgium) was interviewed, using elicitation techniques to further deepen the data collection. Despite their chronic illnesses, all participating students were academically motivated, although some students indicated that not feeling well could cause temporary motivational regression. We were able to distinguish differences in motivation and expected need support. More controlled motivated students from the university hospital schools indicated a preference for support in terms of relatedness. More autonomously motivated students from a hospital school within a revalidation center showed more autonomous motivation and preferred competence support, instead of the autonomy-support that would be expected according to self-determination theory.

J	Yong, ST; Tiong, KM				Yong, Su Ting; Tiong, Kung Ming			A Blended Learning Approach: Motivation and Difficulties in Learning Programming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION												This study explored students' motivation and difficulties in learning programming in a blended learning environment. The face-to-face classroom instructions were blended with digital learning instructions. The study adopted a convergent parallel design mixed methods research and involved 209 pre-university students. The findings were as follows: (1) Looping was hard. Students faced difficulties in program design, problem-solving, and debugging of repetition structures. (2) Students with prior programming experience were more motivated to learn by innate psychological needs: autonomy and competence. (3) Competence-motivated students performed better in programming, but no significant findings for autonomy and relatedness motivated students. A blended learning environment must be structured around the nature of the subject to satisfy students' innate psychological needs. Digital learning materials can support understanding of certain programming concepts, but teaching instructors play an important role in providing academic, mental, and emotional support.																			1550-1876	1550-1337					2022	18	1								10.4018/IJICTE.301276	http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/IJICTE.301276													WOS:000915762800001
J	Hausmann, R; Hidalgo, CA				Hausmann, Ricardo; Hidalgo, Cesar A.			The network structure of economic output	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH												Much of the analysis of economic growth has focused on the study of aggregate output. Here, we deviate from this tradition and look instead at the structure of output embodied in the network connecting countries to the products that they export. We characterize this network using four structural features: the negative relationship between the diversification of a country and the average ubiquity of its exports, and the non-normal distributions for product ubiquity, country diversification and product co-export. We model the structure of the network by assuming that products require a large number of non-tradable inputs, or capabilities, and that countries differ in the completeness of the set of capabilities they have. We solve the model assuming that the probability that a country has a capability and that a product requires a capability are constant and calibrate it to the data to find that it accounts well for all of the network features except for the heterogeneity in the distribution of country diversification. In the light of the model, this is evidence of a large heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities across countries. Finally, we show that the model implies that the increase in diversification that is expected from the accumulation of a small number of capabilities is small for countries that have a few of them and large for those with many. This implies that the forces that help drive divergence in product diversity increase with the complexity of the global economy when capabilities travel poorly.

A Method to Estimate Entity Performance from Mentions to Related Entities in Texts on the Web	IIWAS2019: THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION INTEGRATION AND WEB-BASED APPLICATIONS & SERVICES					21st International Conference on Information Integration and Web-Based Applications and Services (iiWAS)	DEC 02-04, 2019	Munich, GERMANY	Assoc Comp Machinery				Publications on the Web can influence the public opinion about certain entities (e.g., politicians, institutions). At the same time, a variety of indicators can be extracted from these publications and used to estimate entity performance (e.g., popularity, votes share). This work proposes an automatic method that employs state-of-the-art natural language processing tools to extract indicators about entities mentioned in texts, for estimating the performance of these entities or semantically related ones. Our method calculates performance metrics from performance indicators consolidated for semantically related entities, assess correlations of these consolidated metrics with ground true performance, and uses these metrics to predict certain fluctuations in entity performance. Experimental results in a case study on politics show that consolidated metrics for several interrelated entities are better correlated to observed real performance measures of some target entities and lead to better predictions, than metrics for just one entity.					de Macedo, Douglas D.

This study examines a wide range of personality-, family-, and partnership-related predictors of contraceptive behavior in a sample of 1.137 sexually active, heterosexual 16-18 year-olds from the German Family Panel pairfam. Overall 72.4 % of the sexually active youths practiced very consistent contraception in the past 3 months, while 27.4 % reported practicing it less consistently or not at all. Logistic regressions revealed that consistent contraception is best practiced in the context of an ongoing partnership. For males, level of school education, young age at first intercourse (max. 14 years), and conscientiousness also matter. Neither partnership-related factors (duration, related-ness) proved relevant nor features of the family such as economic deprivation, nuclear family type or migration status.																			1436-1957						2015	35	3					252	267																WOS:000360326000003
J	Maddens, L; Depaepe, F; Raes, A; Elen, J				Maddens, Louise; Depaepe, Fien; Raes, Annelies; Elen, Jan			Fostering students' motivation towards learning research skills: the role of autonomy, competence and relatedness support	INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE												In order to design learning environments that foster students' research skills, one can draw on instructional design models for complex learning, such as the 4C/ID model (in: van Merrienboer and Kirschner, Ten steps to complex learning, Routledge, London, 2018). However, few attempts have been undertaken to foster students' motivation towards learning complex skills in environments based on the 4C/ID model. This study explores the effects of providing autonomy, competence and relatedness support (in Deci and Ryan, Psychol Inquiry 11(4): 227-268, https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01, 2000) in a 4C/ID based online learning environment on upper secondary school behavioral sciences students' cognitive and motivational outcomes. Students' cognitive outcomes are measured by means of a research skills test consisting of short multiple choice and short answer items (in order to assess research skills in a broad way), and a research skills task in which students are asked to integrate their skills in writing a research proposal (in order to assess research skills in an integrative manner). Students' motivational outcomes are measured by means of students' autonomous and controlled motivation, and students' amotivation. A pretest-intervention-posttest design was set up in order to compare 233 upper secondary school behavioral sciences students' outcomes among (1) a 4C/ID based online learning environment condition, and (2) an identical condition additively providing support for students' need satisfaction. Both learning environments proved equally effective in improving students' scores on the research skills test. Students in the need supportive condition scored higher on the research skills task compared to their peers in the baseline condition. Students' autonomous and controlled motivation were not affected by the intervention. Although, unexpectedly, students' amotivation increased in both conditions, students' amotivation was lower in the need supportive condition compared to students in the baseline condition. Theoretical relationships were established between students' need satisfaction, students' motivation (autonomous, controlled, and amotivation), and students' cognitive outcomes. These findings are discussed taking into account the COVID-19 affected setting in which the study took place.						depaepe, fien/0000-0001-5440-1318; Raes, Annelies/0000-0001-9237-9385													0020-4277	1573-1952				FEB	2023	51	1					165	199		10.1007/s11251-022-09606-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11251-022-09606-4		DEC 2022						36589895					WOS:000903480900001
J	Romao, J				Romao, Joao			Variety, Smart Specialization and Tourism Competitiveness	SUSTAINABILITY												This work analyzes how regional tourism dynamics (demand, supply and specialization) and innovation performance may influence tourism competitiveness. The novelty and originality of the analysis is the inclusion of aspects related to the sectorial priority options defined within smart specialization strategies in European regions as potential explanatory factors. By using a panel data model and focusing on regions where tourism is one of the priority sectors for Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS3, 2014-2020), the results reveal positive impacts of tourism demand, supply and specialization on the value added produced by tourism activities. Moreover, immaterial aspects related to the qualification of the regional labor force and innovation dynamics (investment in research in development) also exert a positive impact on tourism competitiveness. The novel results obtained regarding the impacts of smart specialization strategies show a high potential of the tourism sector to benefit from geographical, cultural and institutional forms of proximity. The results also suggest that knowledge externalities arising from interactions with both related or unrelated sectors-by exploiting interactions and connectivity with sectors with both low and high cognitive distances-may emerge.

Although existing literature documents the agglomeration effect of industrial clusters in affecting firms' strategic decisions, less is known about how the heterogeneous cluster linkages at the national level affect the foreign market expansion of EMNEs. Based on a supply chain perspective, this study investigates the different cluster linkages between countries based on their upstream/downstream relations. We find that upstream-downstream (U-D) cluster linkages reduce the EMNEs' expansionary entries into a foreign country, while the downstream-upstream (D-U) linkages lead to an increase in expansionary entries. These relationships are adversely moderated by firm-cluster relatedness. We also find that the expansionary entries of EMNEs positively affect their performance, and the relationship is moderated by the institutional environments in host countries. In summary, this study informs a more holistic understanding of the complexity of global production networks, considering the interplay between firms, clusters, and institutions.

This study follows an engagement perspective to examine the responses of stakeholders to the incorporation of the essential elements of Sport Education within an elective physical education basketball sports club. Participants were 152 students who after five weeks of term could elect to participate in a Sport Education season or continue to practice individually. Dependent measures included club attendance, students' perceptions of competence, knowledge/understanding and enjoyment of basketball. In addition, the teacher kept a reflective log across the season and participated in a formal interview at season's end. The students who participated in the Sport Education option had significantly greater attendance than their skill practice classmates. Further, they reported significant improvements in competence, as well as a higher level of enjoyment over their previous college physical education experience. These results demonstrate that highly autonomous format of the basketball club is conducive in supporting students' engagement in physical education.

The MOOC, Travailler en francais (https://sites.google.com/site/mooctravailleren-francais/home), was a 5-week open online course for learners of French at level B1 of the CEFR, and aimed to develop language and employability skills for working in a francophone country. It took place in early 2014 and attracted more than 1000 participants. Intrinsic motivation (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) is directly linked to one's enjoyment of accomplishing a task. We conducted a study based on the cognitive variables of the Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), and adapted the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory to the context of a MOOC in order to understand the expectancy beliefs and task values of participants engaging with the MOOC. Participants answered a 40 Likert-type questions on enjoyment/interest (i.e. I will enjoy doing this MOOC very much), perceived competence (i.e. I think I will be able to perform successfully in the MOOC), effort (i.e. I will put a lot of effort in this MOOC), value/usefulness (i.e. I think that doing this MOOC will be useful for developing my skills), felt pressure and tension (i.e. I think I might feel pressured while doing the MOOC) and relatedness (i.e. I think I will feel like I can really trust the other participants). Results highlight significant factors that could directly influence intrinsic motivation for learning in a MOOC environment. The chapter makes recommendations for LMOOC designers based on the emerging profile of MOOC participants, on their motivation and self-determination, as well as on the pressures they might feel, including time pressures. Finally, the extent to which participants relate to each other, and are able to engage in social learning and interaction, is a real challenge for LMOOC designers.

Cartograph extends previous systems that visualize non-spatial data using geographic approaches. While these systems required data with an existing semantic structure, Cartograph unlocks spatial visualization for a much larger variety of datasets by enhancing input datasets with semantic information extracted from Wikipedia. Cartograph's map embeddings use neural networks trained on Wikipedia article content and user navigation behavior. Using these embeddings, the system can reveal connections between points that are unrelated in the original data sets, but are related in meaning and therefore embedded close together on the map. We describe the design of the system and key challenges we encountered, and we present findings from an exploratory user study.																					978-1-4503-4348-0				2017							179	190		10.1145/3025171.3025233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3025171.3025233													WOS:000458177700019

Physical activity needs and experiences are becoming increasingly diverse, yet there is a paucity of research on issues associated with university students' physical activity needs, and their perceptions of their physical activity needs and sustainable well-being are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study combines Self-Determination Theory with the existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) Theory of Needs to explore the mediating effects of different variables on the relationship between university students' physical activity needs and sustainable well-being. A total of 900 Chinese university students were invited through an online survey to participate in this study, and the collected data were validated with a structural equation model. According to the results of the study, it was found that the level of involvement and flow experience in university students' sports activities have a mediating effect on the relationship between needs and sustainable well-being. Therefore, educators can enhance the level of sustainable well-being by stimulating university students' physical activity needs and improving their level of involvement and participation experience.

Acquisition experience and production resource efficiency: Evidence from US manufacturing industries	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT												Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how the acquisition experience - an acquiring firm's experience of acquiring and integrating the resources of an acquired firm - affects the production resource efficiency of the acquiring firm. Design/methodology/approach The authors used data obtained from US manufacturing industries over the 1992-2014 period. The sample includes 784 acquisitions by 417 firms. The proposed hypotheses were tested through econometric analysis. Findings Results show that the acquisition experience has a positive association with production resource efficiency. The acquisition experience is most positively associated with acquiring firms' production efficiency when they successfully accomplished previous performance outcomes. While the literature has recognized the relatedness of acquiring and acquired firms as a contextual moderator, the interaction of the related acquisition and the acquisition experience has no impact on efficiency benefits.

This leads to the diversity of the similar services and their developed nature, which makes the discovery of a relevant service during the composition phase a complex task. Since most of the competition companies aim to discover high-quality services with minimum charges in order to increase the number of customers and their profit. The semantic WSs allow performing dynamic service discovery through the entities software and intelligent agents. However, the solutions provided to the discovery process are limited to their performance in terms of the quickness to respond to the request in real-time, without considering the constraints such as the accuracy in the discovery phase and the quality of the similarity mechanism evaluation. They usually are based on the similarity measure of distance between concepts in the ontology instead of taking into consideration the relationships semantically and the strength of the semantic relationship between concepts in the context. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid semantic similarity method to improve the service discovery process. The hybrid method is applied to an architecture based on mobile agents, where cooperative agents are integrated to facilitate and speed up the discovery process. In the first hybrid method, we defined the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) with a semantic relatedness measure to avoid the ambiguity of the terms and obtain a purely semantic relatedness at level of the service description. The second one is defined to analyze the relationships at the level of the I/O service based on the subsumption reasoning, called IO-MATCHING. Experimental results on a real data set demonstrate that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and consumed time of the service discovery.

J	Böhmer, N; Schinnenburg, H				Bohmer, Nicole; Schinnenburg, Heike			Career decisions of Indian female talent: implications for gender-sensitive talent management	EMPLOYEE RELATIONS												Purpose Talent scarcity in emerging economies such as India poses challenges for companies, and limited labour market participation among well-educated women has been observed. The reasons that professionals decide not to pursue a further corporate career remain unclear. By investigating career decision-making, this article aims to highlight (1) the contextual factors that impact those decisions, (2) individuals' agency to handle them and (3) the implications for talent management (TM). Design/methodology/approach Following a qualitative research design, computer-aided analysis was conducted on interviews with 24 internationally experienced Indian business professionals. A novel application of neo-institutionalism in the Indian context was combined with the family-relatedness of work decisions (FRWD) model. Findings Career decisions indicate that rebellion against Indian societal and family expectations is essential to following a career path, especially for women. TM as part of the current institutional framework serves as a legitimising facade veiling traditional practices that hinder females' careers. Research limitations/implications Interviewees adopted a retrospective perspective when describing their career decisions; therefore, different views might have existed at the moment of decision-making. Practical implications Design and implementation of gender-sensitive TM adjusted to fit the specific Indian context can contribute to retaining female talent in companies and the labour market. Originality/value The importance of gender-sensitive TM can be concluded from an empirical study of the context-based career decision-making of experienced business professionals from India. The synthesis of neo-institutionalism, the FRWD model and the research results provides assistance in mapping talent experiences and implications for overcoming the challenges of talent scarcity in India.

J	Harding, S; Smith, LM				Harding, Sarah; Smith, Laura Mazzoli			Freedom through constraint: Young women's embodiment, space and wellbeing during lockdown	WELLBEING SPACE AND SOCIETY												Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdown restrictions in March 2020, young people were suddenly faced with a reduction and reconfiguration of the spaces in which they could 'be'. This paper explores how in this lockdown context, young women (aged 10-20) experienced their bodies and wellbeing, where traditional social connections (particularly school and physical connections) were not possible. Based on qualitative responses (n = 511) from an online, open-ended survey on wellbeing, physical activity, body image and social media usage, we explore how a reduction and reconfiguration of space, understood relationally, contributes to an individual's wellbeing. Using abductive reasoning and taking a phenomenological approach, we concentrate on the embodied experience of wellbeing and how this links to the spaces in which the body is lived. We suggest that the removal of spaces during lockdown, which on the one hand can be seen as problematic for maintaining wellbeing, also enabled many young women to experience new connections - with their bodies, family, and the environment and nature, that supplemented previous connections and fostered positive relationships and wellbeing. The removal of specific performative modes of judgement associated with the school environment was a positive influence on many young women's relationships with their own bodies and their wider construction of wellbeing, but increased use of social media spaces were found to reconstitute these performative experiences. The benefits of the specific and newly delimited freedoms associated with the forced lockdown have implications for an understanding of embodied wellbeing that is not individual, instead embedded inextricably in relations of connectedness with others in space and the nature of these intersubjective experiences.																			2666-5581						2022	3								100101	10.1016/j.wss.2022.100101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2022.100101								35990881					WOS:001108019700013

Roman			Life satisfaction linked to the diversity of nature experiences and nature views from the window	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The effects of nature interactions on multiple aspects of human subjective wellbeing are increasingly well understood. Although nature experience has been shown to be positively associated with life satisfaction, it remains unknown whether the diversity of nature experiences contributes to increased life satisfaction and whether the relationship is mediated by a person's strength of connection with nature. We conducted a national survey in Singapore through online questionnaires (n = 1, 262), where we measured frequency, duration, diversity of nature experiences, and presence or absence of nature views from windows at home and at the workplace. We also measured participants' strength of connection with nature (how strongly a person identifies with nature). We found that people who visited more diverse types of natural spaces (ranging from wild nature, managed parks, and beaches) had higher life satisfaction. The presence of nature views from windows at the home and/or at the workplace was also linked with higher life satisfaction. We also found that people with a stronger connection with nature had higher life satisfaction when they spent more than one hour in natural spaces per week, while this relationship was weak for people without a strong connection with nature. Our results suggest that urban planning should aim to provide a diversity of natural spaces to increase life satisfaction.					zhang, yu/HNS-5948-2023; Fuller, Richard/B-7971-2008; Oh, Rachel R.

WSD algorithms, therefore, mostly rely on an External Source of Knowledge like a Thesaurus or Ontology to automatically select the proper concept of an ambiguous term in a given Window of Context. SenseRelate is a well-known WSD algorithm, which use a fixed window size and taking into consideration the distance weight on how far the terms in the context are from the target word. This may impact negatively on the yielded concepts or senses. To overcome this problem, and therefore to enhance the process of Biomedical WSD, in this paper we propose a simple modified versions of SenseRelate Algorithm named NoDistanceSenseRelate which simply ignore the distance, that is the terms in the context will have the same distance weight. In this study, we realize a comparative study between SenseRelate and NoDistanceSenseRelate methods, and evaluate the effect of context window size to WSD Context-Based, by exploiting Semantic Similarity and Relatedness measures extracted from Biomedical Resources. We evaluate our system on a biomedical dataset (MSH-WSD) that contains 203 ambiguous terms and acronyms. The obtained results show that NoDistanceSenseRealte method consistently obtain higher disambiguation accuracy on window size of 3, However on window size of 2, SenseRelate method obtain higher disambiguation accuracy than NoDistance-SenseRealte.						lachkar, abdelmonaime/0000-0003-4980-0191															978-1-4673-7689-1				2016																								WOS:000386352000061

Empirical evidence from emerging economy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS AND SYSTEMS												Purpose - This study aims to gain insight into factors that impact employee readiness to change and organisational change management. Therefore, an integrative research model is developed with the combination of perceived competence, perceived relatedness, perceived autonomy, codification strategy and personalization strategy to investigate employee readiness to change. The research model tests the mediating role of employee readiness to change between factors underpinned self-determination theory, knowledge management strategy and organizational change management. In addition to the moderating role of self-efficacy is examined between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation. Design/methodology/approach - This research is conducted under a positive paradigm, and therefore, a quantitative research approach is incorporated to design a research strategy. The research model is empirically tested with a sample size of 361 employees working in commercial banks of Pakistan. For data analysis, the structural equation modelling approach is applied. Findings - Empirical findings indicate that altogether perceived competence, perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness, codification and personalization strategies had explained 76.8% variance in employee readiness to change. The effect size analysis shows that codification strategy has the largest impact in determining employee readiness to change. Therefore, the relatedness of employee tasks stands at the second stage in determining employee readiness to change. The predictive relevance of the research model is computed through blindfolding procedure and revealed substantial predictive relevance in measuring employee readiness to change. The findings of the research confirmed that the relationship between employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation will be stronger when self-efficacy is higher. Practical implications - The current research has several contributions to theory and practice. Theoretically, this research extends the self-determination theory with knowledge management strategy and enriches literature in employee readiness to change and organizational change management context. Practically, this research suggests that policymakers should focus on factors underpinned by self-determination theory and knowledge management model to develop a positive attitude among employees towards readiness to change. Similarly, self-efficacy is another important factor that moderates the relationship between readiness to change and change implementation and should be considered for managerial implication. Originality/value - This research is significant as it integrates two unique models, namely, the self-determination framework and the knowledge management model to investigate employee readiness to change. In addition to that, the research model is extended with the moderating effect of self-efficacy between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation.

A less exploited resource is Wikipedia that stores more than 10400 articles about human genes: each gene name identifies the corresponding Wikipedia page resuming gene's properties in short sentences where hyperlinks define relationships with other genes in Wikipedia. This paper evaluates the extent to which the Wikipedia can be trusted for assessing the similarity of a gene pair as the distance between their Wikipedia pages. We present a set of experiments that make use of TagMe (a powerful tool for evaluating the distance of two Wikipedia pages based on their annotations) to calculate the semantic similarity of several sets of genes on Wikipedia. Results compare well with gold standards and semantic similarity values evaluated on gene ontologies. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Wikipedia in recognizing functional groups of genes, the quality and the wealth of its knowledge about genes as well the accuracy of TagMe.																					978-1-5386-1759-5				2017							164	169		10.1109/WETICE.2017.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2017.19													WOS:000426913000035

The participants were Secondary One (S1, Grade Seven) students from Singapore who scored below the cohort's mean score in a national test administered at the end of primary education, and were identified as low risk (n=309) or high risk (n=396), based on their S1 achievement score in the English Language subject. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with academic risk status as criterion variable and the following potential predictors: students' background variables (i.e. socio-economic status, cognitive ability and initial achievement), personal strengths, teacher-student relatedness, and teacher autonomy and competence support. After controlling for the effects of the students' background variables, teacher trust emerged as the strongest (negative) and most stable predictor of high-risk status; teacher alienation and teacher-student communication were found as significant positive predictors of students' placement in the high-risk group.

The central hypothesis states that technologies that become more central to the knowledge base are also characterized by a higher connectedness of the inventor network. The theoretical considerations are exemplified in a comparative study of two patenting fields-information technology and semiconductors. It turns out that information technology shows the highest increases in patents, but only a moderate move towards the center of the knowledge base. By contrast, semiconductors develops towards a key technology, despite a moderate increase in the number of patents. The dynamic analysis of inventor networks in both fields shows an increasing connectedness and the emergence of a large component in semiconductors, but not in information technology, which is in line with the expectations.

Incremental and radical innovative activities in the automotive sector	INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION												The development of low emission vehicles (LEVs) represents a typical case of technological competition between two green trajectories. On the one hand, the incremental trajectory aims at improving the efficiency of the dominant design, greening the internal combustion engine (ICEG). On the other hand, the radical trajectory targets the progress of hybrid, electric and fuel cell vehicles (HEF). This paper studies the innovative behaviours of firms in the automotive sector patenting in both trajectories. It investigates the extent to which technological leadership in green patents is rooted in firms' knowledge and capabilities accumulated in brown domains. Using a novel dataset of automotive firms with patenting activity at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 2001 and 2018, we find that related 'brown knowledge' denotes leadership in green trajectories.

Design/methodology/approach - Partial Least Squares was used to develop a mediation model explaining the underlying mechanism between contingent reward leadership and willing organizational commitment. Findings - The data indicates that, as expected, the relationship between transactional leadership and willing commitment in the manufacturing organization was mediated by both competence and relatedness; however, in the healthcare organization, to the surprise, this relationship was mediated by competence only. Practical implications - The authors develop a model that could help organizational managers and consultants improve the productivity and effectiveness of their work by taking the findings into account.

We will answer two theoretical questions, given a small size training sample: 1) under what conditions does MTL perform better than single-task learning (STL)? And 2) under what conditions does MTL guarantee the consistency of all tasks during learning? In contrast to the conventional task-summation based MTL, the introduction of VF form enables us to detect the behavior of each task and the task-group relatedness in MTL. Specifically, the task-group relatedness examines how the success (or failure) of some tasks affects the performance of the other tasks. By deriving the specific deviation and symmetrization inequalities for VFs, we obtain a generalization bound for MTL to the upper bound of the joint probability that there is at least one task with a large generalization gap. To answer the first question, we discuss how the synergic relatedness between task groups affects the generalization performance of MTL and shows that MTL outperforms STL if almost any pair of complementary task groups is predominantly synergic. Moreover, to answer the second question, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee the consistency of each task in MTL, which requires that the function class of each task should not have high complexity. In addition, our findings provide a strategy to examine whether the task settings will enjoy the advantages of MTL.

J	Chakrabarti, A; Mitchell, W				Chakrabarti, Abhirup; Mitchell, Will			The Persistent Effect of Geographic Distance in Acquisition Target Selection	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE												Valuable resources often exist at distant points from a firm's current locations, with the result that strategic decisions such as growth have a spatial dimension in which firms seek information and choose between geographically distributed alternatives. Studies show that geographic proximity facilitates the flow of resources, but there is limited understanding of factors that exacerbate or ease the impact of geographic distance when firms seek new resources. This paper argues that the difficulty of search increases with distance, particularly when search involves greater information processing, but that firms can partially overcome the constraints of distance with direct, contextual, and vicarious learning. We study 2,070 domestic acquisition announcements by U.S. chemical manufacturers founded after 1979. The results demonstrate the persistent effect of spatial geography on organizational search processes.

J	Sabyrbekov, R; Dallimer, M; Navrud, S				Sabyrbekov, Rahat; Dallimer, Martin; Navrud, Stale			Nature affinity and willingness to pay for urban green spaces in a developing country	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban green spaces (UGS) provide multiple ecosystem services to city residents and are often their only places to spend time in a natural environment. Rapid urbanisation poses difficult choices for city planners who frequently decide to prioritise built infrastructure over retaining or enhancing green spaces, not least because the value of green spaces is rarely recognised in policy and planning processes. This is particularly true in developing countries which face rapidly growing populations and trade-offs between the growing demand for built infrastructure and access to nature. We address the value of public UGS using both a monetary approach and a nonmonetary approach. A Contingent Valuation (CV) survey was used to elicit householderg willingness-to-pay (WTP) for three different scenarios to enhance public UGS provision in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Scenarios were based on ongoing public debates on how to address the degradation and loss of existing park areas and on current plans to build new parks. The same survey also employed the Nature Relatedness (NR) scale, which measures individual cognitive attachment to nature, as a non-monetary valuation approach. Our findings showed that a high attachment to nature does not necessarily lead to higher WTP for improved provision of public UGS as WTP is constrained by household characteristics such as income, education and household size. We concluded that monetary valuation techniques could potentially underestimate the value attached to UGS by some population groups (e.g. rural migrants and pensioners) that attach great importance to UGS but whose values are not reflected in a high WIT. Thus, we argue that the assessment of the value of UGS would benefit from combining monetary and non-monetary approaches under various institutional contexts; and that this would be particularly important for cities in developing countries.

Existing subject indexing systems generally produce binary outcomes (either assign or not assign a subject descriptor) that do not adequately reflect the extent to which a document is associated with the assigned subject descriptors. An automated weighting mechanism for subject descriptors is needed to strengthen the role of the subject metadata field. This study compares five measures for automated weighting subject descriptors in documents. The performance of the measures is evaluated according to their ability to discriminate major descriptors from non-major ones. Experiments on a medical collection with 348,566 articles suggest that all the measures are able to rank the major descriptors significantly higher than the non-major ones. Jaccard coefficient, Cosine similarity, and KL Divergence showed better performance than Mutual Information and Log Likelihood Ratio. The findings of this study contribute to the development of weighted subject indexing systems that have direct applications for aiding users' information seeking and improving knowledge organization in digital libraries.

J	Mutter, J				Mutter, Joanne			The global mobility decisions of professional sailors' spouses	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL MOBILITY-THE HOME OF EXPATRIATE MANAGEMENT RESEARCH												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors informing spousal global mobility decisions within the context of sporting expatriation. Findings contribute to the non-corporate global mobility literature as well as providing an empirical enhancement to the family relatedness of work decisions framework. Design/methodology/approach - In this qualitative study, in-depth interviews gave voice to 21 spouses of professional sailors who have experienced both trailing their spouse and staying behind. Findings - Access to empathetic social support, the potential impact on children, and the spouse's career were all found to influence the spouse's dynamic global mobility decision making. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the research. Future longitudinal research into the impact of spousal preferences would identify the on-going effect of their decision(s) to relocate or to stay behind. Practical implications - Providing organisations with an understanding of the familial issues their global talent may factor into their work mobility decisions will allow them to implement appropriate family-focussed support, irrespective of the choice to engage, or not engage, in global mobility. Originality/value - By grounding the study in the under-researched sporting arena, the author contributes to the emerging non-corporate expatriate conversation. Furthermore, the family relatedness of work-related decisions framework was found to provide a useful conceptual foundation for understanding decision making in an international context.

Basic Psychological Needs in Spanish Athletes: validation of the "Basic Needs Satisfaction in Sport Scale"	APUNTS EDUCACION FISICA Y DEPORTES												In view of the growing interest in the satisfaction of basic psychological needs in the area of physical activity and sport, different instruments are being used to evaluate the degree of satisfaction or frustration of these needs. One such instrument is the (BNSSS), which is also relevant in that it acknowledges three factors, hitherto not evaluated, in the autonomy dimension (choice, volition and internal perceived locus of causality). In Spain, the BNSSS has only been validated for team sports, which is why the primary objective of this study was to validate it for use in any sport (individual or team). The study featured the participation of 795 athletes, 50.8% of whom were men and 49.2% women, with a mean age of 18.36 years (SD: 6.06). The EQS 6.3 program was used to perform a confirmatory factor analysis, factorial invariance for the gender, age, competitive level and sport type variables, as well as composite reliability between factors. Good model fit was observed, with comparative fit indexes (CFI) and non-normed fit indexes (NNFI) of .97, and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.06. Factorial invariance was observed for the proposed subgroups and the composite reliably indexes were above .70. Therefore, the measurement instrument has good psychometric properties that make it possible to assess the satisfaction of basic psychological needs in the Spanish sports setting.

J	Taalbi, J				Taalbi, Josef			Evolution and structure of technological systems - An innovation output network	RESEARCH POLICY												The mechanisms responsible for the structure and evolution of technological systems are not fully understood. This study examines the network of supply and use of significant innovations across industries in Sweden, 1970-2013. The results suggest that at least 30% of innovation patterns can be statistically predicted by network stimulus from both backward and forward linkages in the Swedish economy. The network is hierarchical, characterized by hubs that connect diverse industries in closely knitted communities. To account for the structure and evolution of innovation networks, the study proposes a preferential weight assignment process, allowing historical technological linkages and proximities to influence future outcomes. The empirical results show that the properties of the Swedish innovation network are strongly predicted by this process, while skill, knowledge and economic interdependencies have significant but more complex effects on link formation. The results are consistent with the idea that innovations emerge in synergistic communities, but suggest that the transformation of technological systems is shaped by technological requirements, imbalances, and opportunities that are not straightforwardly related to other economic or knowledge proximities.

In this paper, we applied them to academic literature and social media's contents in the field of diabetes to find distinctions between the perceptions of biomedical experts and the public. We analyzed and compared the experts' and the public's networks constituted by the extracted entities and relations. The results confirmed that there are some differences in their views, i.e., biomedical entities that interest them and relations within their knowledge range.

The vast majority of languages and data structures used by network device manufacturers, such as SNMP-based designs and Command Line Interfaces, are data-oriented and are not conducive to representing semantic knowledge. Furthermore, such languages have no ability to represent business concepts, such as a Service Level Agreement, or higher-level concepts, such as the ability to maximize revenue for all users. To solve this problem, we draw inspiration from semantic routing, which traditionally has been used to connect users and applications with desired content and services based on intent, meaning, and other semantic qualities. We define a type of semantic routing that can be used for both semantic querying and network management tasks, and use it to create a semantic overlay network that enables routing to be done on the meaning of the packets. This can be used to provide valuable insight into how best to implement personalized and context-aware services, as well as choose between multiple reconfiguration alternatives for a given scenario.																			1865-0929		978-3-642-14170-6				2010	84						163	176																WOS:000289402600014
J	Meijers, E; Peris, A				Meijers, Evert; Peris, Antoine			Using toponym co-occurrences to measure relationships between places: review, application and evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES												While there is consensus that network embeddedness of cities is of great importance for their development, the precise effect is difficult to assess because of a lack of consistent information on relations between cities. This paper presents, applies and evaluates a rather novel method to establish the strength of relationships between places, a method we refer to as 'the toponym co-occurrence method'. This approach builds the urban system on the basis of co-occurrences of place names in a text corpus. We innovate by exploiting a so far unparalleled amount of data, namely the billions of web pages contained in the common crawl web archive, and by applying the method also to small places that tend to be ignored by other methods. The entire settlement system of the Netherlands is consequently explored. In addition, we innovatively apply machine learning techniques to classify these relations. Much attention is paid to solving biases deriving from place name disambiguation. Gravity modelling is employed to assess the resulting spatial organization of the Netherlands. It turns out that the gravity model fits very well with the pattern of relationships between places as found in digital space, which contributes to our assessment that the toponym co-occurrence method is a solid proxy for relationships in real space. Using the method, it is established that the relationships in the Randstad region, by many considered a coherent metropolitan entity, are actually somewhat less strong than expected. In contrast, historically important, but nowadays small cities in the periphery tend to have maintained their prominent position in the pattern of relationships. Suburban, relatively new places in the shadow of a larger city tend to be weakly related to other places. Several suggestions to further improve the method, in particular the classification of relationships, are discussed.

Among academics, the opportunity to telework has been embraced by most, but it is unclear how it relates to their health and well-being. The aim of this study was to determine how frequency and amount of telework is associated with perceived health, stress, recuperation, work-life balance, and intrinsic work motivation among teaching and research academics. An electronic questionnaire was sent to junior lecturers, senior lecturers, and professors at Swedish public universities. It included the General Health Questionnaire, Work Stress Questionnaire, items for assessing recuperation, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Work scale, and parts of Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, as well as questions about the frequency and amount of telework performed. In total, 392 academics responded to the survey. Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups of academics with different telework frequency (p< 0.05). Univariate analyses of variance showed that ratings of stress related to indistinct organization and conflicts were higher among academics that telework several times per week or more than among academics that telework less than once per month. In regression analyses of associations between amount of telework (in hours per week) and the dependent variables, no significant effects were found. Although it cannot be concluded whether stress is a cause or an effect of frequent telework, the findings warrant further attention to academics who telework frequently.

We focus on sectoral environmental productivity of Italian Regions by exploiting the Regional Accounting Matrix including Environmental Accounts (Regional NAMEA). Patent applications have been extracted by the Patstat Database and assigned to the environmental domain by adopting different international classifications of green technologies: the latest release of the OECD ENV-TECH indicators, and the union of this with the previously established WIPO Green Inventory. Econometric results outline that regions-sectors characterized by higher levels of green technologies (GTs) are those facing better environmental performance. These positive effects directly stem from the introduction of GT in the same sector, as well as from the introduction of GT in vertically related sectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

But they are in fact estimated from a sample taken from a population and thus the variability of the estimates has to be taken into account. Within a Bayesian framework, the evaluation of DNA mixtures accounting for sampling variability in the population database of allele frequencies are discussed in this paper. The concise and general formulae are provided for calculating the likelihood ratio when the people involved are biologically related. The implementation of the formula is demonstrated on the analysis of a real example.

This study explores the interplay of goal framing and basic needs and their effects on customer intentions. This study also examines the underlying mechanism of experience cocreation and the moderating effect of food involvement. Design/methodology/approach This study develops a framework that combines the self-determination theory (SDT) and customer experience cocreation. Two online experimental studies involving 478 US consumers were conducted to examine the underlying mechanism of customers' decision-making on purchasing gourmet meal kits (Study 1) and visiting destination restaurants after receiving the meal kit (Study 2). Findings Intrinsic goal-framing leads to stronger intentions to purchase gourmet meal kits and to visit destination restaurants that sell meal kits. In contrast, extrinsic goal-framing enhances the positive influence of perceived relatedness and competence on behavioral intentions. The effects of goal framing and basic needs on behavioral intentions are moderated by food involvement and mediated by experience cocreation to varying degrees. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is among the first to empirically examine an emerging business model - delivering restaurants' food experiences to out-of-towners. The study also expands the application of the SDT by incorporating customer cocreation as the underlying mechanism.

Our method relies on the use of a semantic network, namely the DBpedia knowledge base, for acquiring fine-grained information about entities and their semantic relations, thus resulting in a knowledge-rich document model. We demonstrate the bene fits of these semantic representations in two tasks: entity ranking and computing document semantic similarity. To this end, we couple DBpedia's structure with an information-theoretic measure of concept association, based on its explicit semantic relations, and compute semantic similarity using a Graph Edit Distance based measure, which finds the optimal matching between the documents' entities using the Hungarian method. Experimental results show that our general model outperforms baselines built on top of traditional methods, and achieves a performance close to that of highly specialized methods that have been tuned to these specific tasks.

We use patent data to identify I4T-related technologies and find that I4Ts are positioned in the periphery of the knowledge space. The study shows that European regions with a high potential in terms of I4T-related technologies are more likely to diversify successfully in new I4Ts.

Both objective and subjective characteristics of a writer are detected. Words have word meaning that is common in the language and that is represented in their usage. Another component of word meaning, "personal sense", not inherent in the language, but different for each person, reflects a meaning of words in terms of unique personal experience and carries the personal characteristics. In our research word meaning techniques are applied to represent personal sense of words in texts by different authors. Personalized concept structures are construed and used to infer authors' perspective from text: various notions of context combined with different thesaurus similarity scales are applied to confirm that from a certain perspective similarity in the personalized thesauri with some restrictions can correspond to similarities in the occupation of the authors.					; Panicheva, Polina/K-3688-2014	Cardiff, John/0000-0003-1863-4557; Panicheva, Polina/0000-0002-9229-6456													0302-9743		978-3-642-13880-5				2010	6177						288	+																WOS:000284034700030

The high potential of this field and its contribution to sustainable development is revealed by being well equipped with advanced production and management tech-nologies. In developing countries, including India, the sec-tor is insufficiently focused on building this capacity and harnessing its effects for progress.The saturation of the economy with innovation and communication diversity gives it increased complexity, non-linearity, interconnectedness and interdependence. Such synergy has two poles. With proper management and ho-listic coverage of complex systems, it generates a cascade of self-reinforcing positive development processes. However, in their absence, there are large-scale problems that hinder the transition to a << green >> model of development, which is especially relevant for the agricultural sector as one of the main pollutants of the environment and the triggers of cli-mate change.The article analyzes the relationship between the com-plex problems, assessing their strength of influence, the de-gree of dependence on other factors.

However, only document-level statistical information is recorded (e.g., document frequency, inverse document frequency) and word semantics cannot be captured. Improvement towards understanding the meaning of words in texts is a challenging task and sufficient background knowledge may need to be incorporated to provide a better semantic representation of texts. In this paper, we present a text mining model that can automatically discover semantic relationships between concepts across multiple documents (where the traditional search paradigm such as search engines cannot help much) and effectively integrate various evidences mined from Wikipedia knowledge. We propose this integration may effectively complement existing information contained in text corpus and facilitate the construction of a more comprehensive representation and retrieval framework. The experimental results demonstrate the search performance has been significantly enhanced against two competitive baselines.					jin, wei/HPD-7106-2023														0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-662-47804-2; 978-3-662-47803-5				2015	9260						161	184		10.1007/978-3-662-47804-2_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-47804-2_8													WOS:000364835300008

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES												Previous research suggests that firms tend to form alliances with counterparts of similar status. However, it remains unclear whether the principle of status homophily helps or hinders the alliance process. In this study, we contend that status differentials, rather than status similarity, can reduce the likelihood of the unplanned dissolution of an alliance, as a clearer order of status helps to resolve interfirm discrepancies and conflicts during collaborative processes. The results based on a sample of joint ventures in the US computer and telecommunications industries support our arguments. Further, we find that the effect of status differentials on the unplanned dissolution of alliances is strengthened when the high-status firm performs better than the low-status firm and when the two firms are from more related industries. Our findings call into question the emphasis on status homophily in the management of alliances following their formation.

J	Lawson, B; Potter, A; Pil, FK; Holweg, M				Lawson, Benn; Potter, Antony; Pil, Frits K.; Holweg, Matthias			Supply chain disruptions: the influence of industry and geography on firm reaction speed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT												Purpose Responding in a timely manner to product recalls emanating from the supply chain presents tremendous challenges for most firms. The source might be a supplier from the same industry located next door, or one from a completely different sector of the economy situated thousands of miles away. Yet the speed of the firm's response is crucial to mitigating the consequences of the recall both for the firm, and consumer health and well-being. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of geographic distance, industry relatedness and clustering on firm response time to a supplier-initiated product recall. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the theoretical framework via an examination of food recall announcements registered with the US Food and Drug Administration over a ten-year period. The authors develop a data set comprising 407 pairs of supplier and affected downstream manufacturing firms, and utilize cross-classified hierarchical linear modeling to understand the drivers of organizational responsiveness. Findings The results suggest that firm response time is lengthened by geographic distance but reduced when the supplier and affected firm operate in related industry sectors. The authors further find that as more firms in a given industry are affected by the same recall, response time deteriorates. Originality/value Product recalls in the agri-food industry are significant events initiated to protect consumer health and ensure the safety of the farm-to-fork food chain. The findings highlight how both geographic- and industry-related factors determine the speed of firm responsiveness to these events.

J	Colombelli, A; Quatraro, F				Colombelli, Alessandra; Quatraro, Francesco			New firm formation and regional knowledge production modes: Italian evidence	RESEARCH POLICY												According to the knowledge-spillovers theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE), local knowledge spillovers affect entrepreneurial dynamics, because of knowledge asymmetries and uncertainty. Most of the empirical literature has tested this hypothesis using a measure of local knowledge stock. This paper is aimed at extending the framework by showing that the domains over which local knowledge spans are also important. The paper investigates the impact of the configuration of local knowledge bases on new firm formation dynamics by combining the KSTE framework with the recombinant knowledge approach. Local knowledge bases emerge from the combination of different knowledge inputs. These inputs may be closely or loosely related to one another. Technological differentiation and the relatedness degree of local competences can be interpreted as characteristics of the local knowledge base interacting with the knowledge filter and the entrepreneurial absorptive capacity. The paper proposes a taxonomy of regional modes of knowledge production and investigates new firm formation in 92 Italian NUTS 3 regions observed over the 1995-2009 time span. The results confirm that the availability of local knowledge pools is important, and show that the 'rich integration' mode is the configuration that favours the entrepreneurial process.

J	Frankel, J				Frankel, Jay			Two forms of solidarity: Their relation to the capacity to think and to alienation	PSYCHOANALYSIS CULTURE & SOCIETY												Self-reflective thinking guards against the flight to authoritarian fantasies and leaders-a flight seen recently, for example, in the election of Donald Trump as US president. The capacity to think reflectively requires a sense of security which, if not internalized, can come from a feeling of belonging. But, if we need to belong to feel secure, how free are we to think differently from the group? I propose two types of solidarity-true solidarity, where a sense of universal kinship fosters compassion and a sense of responsibility for care that makes it important to reflect on what we do; and false solidarity, a shared paranoid/manic fantasy of superiority to a despised group, in which personal thinking threatens a brittle sense of belonging. Right-wing populism is a way to cope with anxieties about economic/culturaldispossession through such fantasies of superiority. But the Left has its own false solidarity-a manic bond that refuses empathy with the pain of the dispossessed on the Right, and even attacks those on the Left who are deemed insufficiently attentive to particular social justice issues. False solidarity is likely to evoke a complementary reaction-similar aggressive, resistant attitudes-in those it targets, resulting in a political impasse. But humility and active compassion may open the way to real dialogue.																			1088-0763	1543-3390				JUN	2017	22	2					123	131		10.1057/s41282-017-0049-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41282-017-0049-9													WOS:000406343000001

Emerging robotic regions in the United States: insights for regional economic evolution	REGIONAL STUDIES												Despite widespread speculation about the potential economic impacts of robotic technology, there has been little academic research on the topic. One barrier to this research is lack of data about the robotics industry or robotics employment. In light of this problem, the authors conducted a robotics census' designed to describe and map the US robotics industry. Several key robotic regions are identified, although they vary in the nature of the robotics industries they host. In addition to reporting the results of the census, it is discussed how the relational and knowledge-spanning qualities of the robotics industry can be important concepts for understanding and facilitating technological change and economic development at the regional level.

However, there are few studies on the use of semantic kernel function in support vector machine for Chinese text classification. This paper constructs a domain-related weight matrix based on statistical features and a semantic kernel function based on the combination of "HowNet" and "Synonyms", and how to make full use of semantic relations in Chinese text to improve classification performance. The semantic kernel function is embedded in the support vector machine classifier for Chinese text classification experiment. The test results show that the accuracy, recall rate and F1 value of the support vector machine (SVM) of the semantic kernel function are higher than that of a single ontology or statistic-based semantic kernel function.																					978-1-4503-5287-1				2017										10.1145/3144789.3144801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3144789.3144801													WOS:000457795400008
J	Kekezi, O; Boschma, R				Kekezi, Orsa; Boschma, Ron			Returns to migration after job loss-The importance of job match	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE												Loss of specific human capital is often identified as a mechanism through which displaced workers might experience permanent drops in earnings after job loss. Research has shown that displaced workers who migrate out of their region of origin have lower earnings than those who do not. This paper extends the discussion on returns to migration by accounting for the type of jobs people get and how related they are to their skills. Using an endogenous treatment model to control for selection bias in migration and career change, we compare displaced stayers with displaced movers in Sweden. Results show that migrants who get a job that matches their occupation- and industry-specific skills display the highest earnings among all displaced workers. If migration is combined with a job mismatch, earning losses are instead observed. This group experiences the lowest earnings among all displaced workers.																			0308-518X	1472-3409				SEP	2021	53	6					1565	1587	0308518X211004577	10.1177/0308518X211004577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308518X211004577		MAR 2021											WOS:000635322700001
J	Sánchez, D; Batet, M; Isern, D; Valls, A				Sanchez, David; Batet, Montserrat; Isern, David; Valls, Aida			Ontology-based semantic similarity: A new feature-based approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Estimation of the semantic likeness between words is of great importance in many applications dealing with textual data such as natural language processing, knowledge acquisition and information retrieval. Semantic similarity measures exploit knowledge sources as the base to perform the estimations. In recent years, ontologies have grown in interest thanks to global initiatives such as the Semantic Web, offering an structured knowledge representation. Thanks to the possibilities that ontologies enable regarding semantic interpretation of terms many ontology-based similarity measures have been developed. According to the principle in which those measures base the similarity assessment and the way in which ontologies are exploited or complemented with other sources several families of measures can be identified. In this paper, we survey and classify most of the ontology-based approaches developed in order to evaluate their advantages and limitations and compare their expected performance both from theoretical and practical points of view. We also present a new ontology-based measure relying on the exploitation of taxonomical features. The evaluation and comparison of our approach's results against those reported by related works under a common framework suggest that our measure provides a high accuracy without some of the limitations observed in other works.

A purposive sample of 1062 secondary PE students (526 boys and 536 girls; M-age ( ) = 14.15, SD = 1.51) participated in this cross-sectional study. Results from latent profile analysis revealed four need satisfaction and frustration profiles: "high need satisfaction-low need frustration"; "moderate need satisfaction-low need frustration"; "moderate need satisfaction-moderate need frustration"; and "low need satisfaction-high need frustration." For outcomes in PE, the "high need satisfaction-low need frustration" profile was the most adaptive, while the "low need satisfaction-high need frustration" profile obtained the most maladaptive pattern of outcomes. The "moderate need satisfaction-low need frustration" profile was more adaptive than the "moderate need satisfaction-moderate need frustration" profile, although both were similar in experiences and oppositional defiance. For outcomes outside of PE, the "high need satisfaction-low need frustration" profile scored highest, while no differences were obtained among the three remaining profiles. These results provide further insight into the importance for PE teachers not only to support students' need satisfaction, but also to minimize need frustration, in obtaining the most optimal pattern of outcomes in PE, as well as a more active lifestyle among students.

J	Liu, Y; Ravichandran, T				Liu, Yu; Ravichandran, T.			A comprehensive investigation on the relationship between information technology investments and firm diversification	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												This paper empirically investigates the role played by information technology in diversified firms by building a demand function for IT investments. First by reviewing the management literature, we briefly examine different types of diversification, including related diversification, unrelated diversification, and geographic diversification. After carefully developing the theoretical arguments we empirically test the relationship between IT investments and different types of diversification. We find that in general diversified firms demand more investments in information technology, but the positive relationship may also depend on the extent to which firms diversify. Our findings show that firms with diversified structures that increase the complexities of coordination and control, e. g. unrelated diversification or extensive geographic diversification, would face a lesser demand for IT investments because of the increased use of financial controls instead of strategic controls by these firms. Overall, we find that information technology can serve as an effective coordination and control mechanism for moderate levels of diversification whereas non-IT mechanisms for coordination and control becomes more suitable in a context of higher levels of diversification. The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

Based on a unique panel of hand-collected data from listed and unlisted Italian firms for the 1980-2010 time period, the results of this study generally reveal the predominant role of the internal capital market arguments. The benefits of unrelated diversification, which include the avoidance of costly external financing, outweigh its costs, which involve opportunistic problems. Although the literature suggests two distinct forces concurrently affect diversification decisions, in the Italian context, financial benefits appear to be the prevailing motivation for unrelated diversification decisions. Furthermore, the internal capital market argument has a strong effect on decisions to engage in unrelated diversification, particularly with respect to firms that are sensitive to financial constraints.

Design/methodology/approach Using 4,624 worldwide M&A deals conducted by Chinese firms from 2009 to 2021, the authors conduct multiple linear regression and ordered probit regression. And comprehensive indexes constructed based on the observed features of acquirer's CEOs are used to be the proxy for CEO risk preference. Findings The results show that the higher-level Chinese acquirer's CEO risk preference is overall positively associated with using more stock in payment. Moreover, the above relationship is strengthened if the ownership of the acquirer is state-owned. Originality/value The authors highlight the importance of the non-economic factors and demonstrate a relationship between the Chinese acquirer's CEO risk preference and the M&A payment method, providing support for and enriching the upper echelons theory (UET).

In this process, the increasing global interconnectedness and internationalisation of innovative activities underlines the growing importance of external knowledge linkages. This paper examines how different categories of countries - technological leaders, catching-up countries and follower countries diversify into green technologies by exploiting different types of external linkages through co-inventions with international partners. The dataset covers 49 countries over a period of 40 years. The results show that it is complementary linkages, rather than external linkages alone, that facilitate related diversification in the green sector. Moreover, while complementary linkages have a significant impact on the ability of catching-up countries and followers to diversify into less complex and widely diffused green technologies, the diversification pattern of leaders is more oriented towards complex technologies in their early stages. Therefore, green technology development policies should actively promote international cooperation as it has the potential to catalyse green catching-up and foster sustainable growth.

J	Meriläinen, M				Merilainen, Mikko			First-Timer Learning Experiences in Global Game Jam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME-BASED LEARNING												Game jams are accelerated game creation events usually taking place over the course of a short time period. A variety of learning outcomes from game jamming has been discussed in previous research, with learning being a common motivation for attending game jams. Despite this, there has been little research into the psychological mechanisms driving learning and participation. In this article, the learning experiences of four first-time participants in the Global Game Jam are examined through self-determination theory. Results suggest that a wide spectrum of learning is experienced during a game jam, and game jams offer at least a temporary heightened sense of creativity and competence. Assessment remains an issue, however, and learning benefits may be contingent on the jam setting. All three basic psychological needs listed in self-determination theory are potentially fulfilled by game jam attendance, suggesting the relevance of self-determination theory in further jam research.

The task of coreference resolution has been the target of intensive research, and the interest at using neural networks, successfully tested in other tasks of natural language processing, has been gradually growing. The role that semantic information plays for the task of coreference resolution has been recognized by researchers, but the impact of semantic features on the performance of neural networks has not been yet described in detail. Here we describe the process of integrating features derived from open-source semantic information into the coreference resolution model based on a neural network, and evaluate its performance in comparison with the base model.

J	Uribe, JN				Uribe, Jose N.			Multipoint contact without forbearance? How coverage synergies shape equity analysts' forecasting performance	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												Research Summary:Scholars regularly use multipoint contact (MPC) to explain how encountering rivals in different domains shapes performance. While most explanations rely on mutual forbearance theory, I propose that competitive deterrence does not adequately explain how MPC shapes performance in knowledge intensive work and argue instead that cross-domain synergies may play a central role. I examine how security analysts' MPC with publicly traded firms captures synergies in their coverage portfolio, which improves forecasting accuracy and information leadership. The advantages of greater MPC for a focal analyst are counterbalanced by rivals' observational learning, which reduces the focal analyst's forecasting differentiation. A natural experiment helps corroborate my argument: rival analysts' forecasting accuracy dropped for firms in which high MPC analysts perished in the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Managerial Summary:Competition in the knowledge economy often unfolds across multiple domains including product markets, geographic locations, and customer segments. In these settings, an actor's level of multipoint contact (MPC) in a domain captures the knowledge and other synergies available to the focal actor, which can improve performance in the domain. In the equity research setting, an analyst's MPC on a focal firm captures the likelihood that the analyst also covers that firm's suppliers, customers and important competitors. Using data on analysts' forecasting performance between 2001 and 2013, I find that greater levels of MPC on a focal firm predicts greater forecasting accuracy and information leadership but also lowers forecasting differentiation by attracting rivals who observe and benefit from the focal analyst's knowledge.																			0143-2095	1097-0266				OCT	2020	41	10					1901	1932		10.1002/smj.3188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smj.3188		JUN 2020											WOS:000543967400001

We argue that the acquisition price reflects opportunities for value creation through innovation and investigate whether acquirers pay not just for the target firm's knowledge but also for the opportunity to access localized knowledge when targets are embedded in the knowledge flows of their region. Accordingly, we integrate embeddedness theory with literature on the expectations for knowledge-based value creation in M & A. We hypothesize that target firms that are highly embedded in local knowledge flows have higher acquisition prices. Using data on 520 technology -oriented firm acquisitions in Europe between 2001 and 2010, we find that the acquisition price increases with the target firm's local embeddedness. The effects are weaker when an acquirer's knowledge base is closely related to the localized knowledge and stronger when the target's knowledge base is closely related to the localized knowledge, suggesting that local embeddedness conditions the ability of acquirer and target to absorb localized knowledge.

Task proximity index: a novel measure for assessing the work-efficiency of assembly line balancing configurations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH												Assembly line balancing (ALB) aims at optimally partitioning the total work required to assemble a product to workstations. In this problem, precedence constraints must be observed on the sequence with which the distinct tasks of the assembly process may be carried out. In contrast to the strict mathematical posture employed in conventional ALB approaches, this paper provides a deep insight on the origin of precedence diagram which illustrates precedence constraints among the tasks. Our review on assembly planning methods reveals that these constraints are deduced from the geometry of the components to be attached, their position in the assembled product and even planner's expertise on the rational order with which the tasks are to be performed. Accordingly, it is explicitly shown through a case study of a real industrial product that the topology of tasks on the precedence diagram may be utilised to obtain more work-efficient ALB configurations. To this end, a metric system is developed to quantify the proximity of the tasks on the precedence diagram and a novel measure, namely the task proximity index, is proposed for assessing ALB solutions from a practical viewpoint.

Mapping the relation and structure of scientific knowledge is therefore central to our understanding of the dynamics of scientific production. Here we introduce a new approach to generate scientific knowledge maps based on a machine learning approach that, starting from the observed publication patterns of authors, generates an N-dimensional space where it is possible to measure the similarity or distance between different research topics and knowledge domains. We provide an implementation of the proposed approach that considers the American Physical Society publications database and generates a map of the research space in Physics that characterizes the relation among research topics over time. We use this map to measure two indicators, the research capacity fingerprint and the knowledge density, to profile the research activity in physical sciences of more than 400 urban areas across the world. We show that these indicators can be used to analyze and predict the evolution over time of the research capacity and specialization of specific geographical areas. Furthermore we provide an extensive analysis of the relation between socio-economic development indicators and the ability to produce new knowledge for 67 countries, as measured by our approach, highlighting some key correlates of scientific production capacity. The proposed approach is scalable to very large datasets and can be extended to study other disciplines and research areas without having to rely on ad-hoc science classification schemes.

We trace the time lag between the introduction and the diffusion of breakthroughs in solar photovoltaic technology and wind power technology. Our results show that both domestic knowledge base and organizational proximity to the country introducing breakthroughs, help latecomer countries catch up by actively innovating in these technologies on their own. Moreover, we find that there are more opportunities for latecomer countries with stronger domestic knowledge base to catch up in solar photovoltaic technology than wind power technology. The results of this paper provide systematic evidence of the technology-sensitive catching-up process in the clean energy technological paradigm.

J	Ascani, A; Bettarelli, L; Resmini, L; Balland, PA				Ascani, Andrea; Bettarelli, Luca; Resmini, Laura; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre			Global networks, local specialisation and regional patterns of innovation	RESEARCH POLICY												A large academic consensus exists on the idea that successful innovative processes are geographically bounded within regions. Nevertheless, the ability of regions to capture and re-use external knowledge is also regarded as a fundamental element to sustain and refine the local profile of specialisation and competitiveness. The present article combines these views to investigate the sources of the regional innovation process, by analysing data on Italian regions over the period 2007-2012. We define global networks based on all the local firms identifiable as global ultimate owners and their foreign subsidiaries. Our main results suggest that both the internal specialisation and the regional external linkages can generate indigenous innovation, but the role of the networks varies substantially according to its density, its degree of complementarity with the specialisation profile, its geographical spread and the specific location of the foreign subsidiaries. Our results, then, support a view of the regional innovation as an interactive process whereby valuable knowledge resources are not only generated within the reach of the local economy, but they are also integrated with external inputs. This contrasts with recent anti-globalisation views according to which the increase in the foreign operations of national companies impoverishes the local economy.

By drawing on previous motivation research we develop a model that describes how a student's sense of belonging in a social setting can transform their goals and experiences. We use the extremes of fear and integrity to model a student's motivation to engage in activities. A student's sense of connection and belonging (or not) in a social setting drives whether she feels integrated with or alienated from her environment. Our model is based on three studies and suggests that a sense of belonging emerges through the alignment of goals and practices of the individual and an activity. This model is applied to two examples to illustrate how social connection or isolation can be exhibited in a physics classroom setting. We conclude by discussing the role of the teacher in designing classroom environments that support students engaging.

J	Guo, ZC; Barbosa, D				Guo, Zhaochen; Barbosa, Denilson			Robust named entity disambiguation with random walks	SEMANTIC WEB												Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of assigning entities from a Knowledge Graph ( KG) to mentions of such entities in a textual document. The state-of-the-art for this task balances two disparate sources of similarity: lexical, defined as the pairwise similarity between mentions in the text and names of entities in the KG; and semantic, defined through some graph-theoretic property of a subgraph of the KG induced by the choice of entities for each mention. Departing from previous work, our notion of semantic similarity is rooted in Information Theory and is defined as the mutual information between random walks on the disambiguation graph induced by choice of entities for each mention. We describe an iterative algorithm based on this idea, and show an extension that uses learning-to-rank, which yields further improvements. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that this approach is robust and very competitive on well-known existing benchmarks. We also justify the need for new and more difficult benchmarks, and provide an extensive experimental comparison of our method and previous work on these new benchmarks.

The method is based on the closeness of goods produced within a country, which is established by the production structure. Products simultaneously present in a country's production structure are close. Products are specified according to the Standard International Trade Classification (sIrc) and, more recently, to the Harmonized System. We argue that, in the context of increasing international production fragmentation, the complexity of economies should be established in line with their specialization by stages in the production composition, origin of the value of exports, backward linkages of exporting sectors, firms, research, and development in exporting sectors, as well as unit prices.																			0041-3011					JAN-MAR	2024	91	361					7	46		10.20430/ete.v91i361.1791	http://dx.doi.org/10.20430/ete.v91i361.1791													WOS:001170841400001

Using a longitudinal study of 339 UK-based small businesses accounting for almost 7000 patents between 1990 and 2006, this study constitutes the first empirical examination of technological diversification among SMEs in the literature. Results demonstrate that technological diversification is not solely a large firm activity, challenging the dominant view that innovative SMEs are extremely focused and specialised players with little technological diversification. Our findings suggest a nonlinear (i.e. inverse-U-shaped) relationship between the level of technological opportunities in the environment and the SSIs' degree of technological diversification. This points to a trade-off between processes of exploration and exploitation across increasingly volatile technology regimes. The paper also demonstrates that small firms with impactful innovations focus their innovative activity around similar technological capabilities while firms that have introduced platform technologies in the past are more likely to engage in technological diversification.

Using partial least squares analysis, survey data from 26 district managers (knowledge coaches) and 102 territory managers (proteges) from a large MNC's subsidiaries in Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the UK is examined. In the first model, appertaining to the knowledge coaches, long-term orientation positively moderated the path between intrinsic motivation and perceived selling skill acquisition. For the corresponding pathway in the protege model, collectivism and power distance attenuated the pathway. The implications for managers in terms of fostering intrinsic motivation to engage in knowledge transfer across a diversity of employees, and avenues for future research are discussed.

J	Kim, SS; Kim, YJ				Kim, Sang Soo; Kim, Yong Jin			The effect of compliance knowledge and compliance support systems on information security compliance behavior	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand from the knowledge management perspective how the mechanism of different voluntary compliance behaviors works and how information technology is used for compliance management in corporate settings where privacy and security issues are getting critical due to the advancement of big data and artificial intelligence. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors propose a structural model based on the theory of planned behavior and the IT relatedness theory that behavioral belief about compliance and social pressure affect compliance knowledge and compliance intention, and compliance knowledge partially mediates the impact of both independent variables on compliance intention. The authors surveyed with a structured questionnaire 975 employees of a major Korean energy company, S-OIL, which deploys a compliance support system. The respondents are classified into two groups: an Active IT Utilization Group and a Passive IT Utilization Group. Findings - The results of our empirical examination show that compliance intention belief and social pressure influence compliance intention, and further, that compliance behavior is mediated by compliance knowledge - in both the active IT utilization group and the passive IT utilization group. However, the significance of each path coefficient, R square and the mediation effect in Model 1 (passive IT utilization group) are obviously a poor contrast to Model 2 (active IT utilization group). Also, the path from behavioral belief to compliance knowledge and social pressure to compliance knowledge show a significant moderating effect of IT utilization level. Originality/value - This paper aims to promote more effective voluntary compliance behavior by increasing the understanding of the impact differences of the preceding factors, and the ways in which those are related to the knowledge management practice in terms of both knowledge itself and its support systems, i.e. compliance support system.

While much research has examined the first months of the pandemic, little is known about how workers have responded to this new work arrangement over time. The stressor-reaction perspective suggests that any strain related to the physical separation from coworkers may persist as long as the stressor is present, while the adaptation perspective implies that individuals adopt new behaviours that help them adjust once the initial shock is over. This research examines the changes in work belongingness, meaningful work, and emotional exhaustion following a shift to high-intensity telecommuting, between September 2020 and March 2021. We conducted a four-wave study among an organizational sample of 716 workers who transitioned to high-intensity telecommuting during the pandemic. Latent growth modelling analyses showed that new high-intensity telecommuters experienced declines in work belongingness over time, which in turn led to decreased perceptions that their work was meaningful and increased emotional exhaustion, supporting the stress-reaction perspective. Contrary to theoretical predictions, trajectories were worse for those with a higher initial affective commitment to coworkers. We discuss how our findings can inform scholars and practitioners about the unfolding consequences of a collective shift to high-intensity telecommuting.																			0963-1798	2044-8325				2024 JAN 30	2024										10.1111/joop.12494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joop.12494		JAN 2024											WOS:001152572300001

Design/methodology/approach - A fixed effects, autoregressive panel model on a comprehensive, longitudinal sample of large and medium-sized publicly traded companies in the USA. Findings - The effect of alliance portfolios on firm performance is conditional on the firm's strategic positioning. Research limitations/implications - The results may not be applicable to firms outside the USA or small firms. Practical implications - Executives should craft their alliance portfolios while considering the strategic positioning of their firms. Originality/value - This paper presents the first study of alliance portfolios that uses a comprehensive, multi-industry sample while considering firms' strategic positioning. The paper is the first to jointly study characteristics of alliance portfolios and firm strategies.

J	Pepper, JW				Pepper, John W.			Simple models of assortment through environmental feedback	ARTIFICIAL LIFE												Social evolution depends critically on assortment, or segregation versus even mixing, between cooperators and noncooperators. Altruistic traits, which reduce the absolute fitness of their bearers, cannot evolve without positive assortment (excess segregation). The question of how positive assortment can arise has been controversial, but Most evolutionary biologists believe that common descent is the only effective general mechanism. Here T investigate another recently proposed mechanism for generating nonrandom assortment, termed This requires only that two forms of a trait affect the quality of the local environment differently in Such a way that all individuals are more likely to leave low-quality locales. Experiments with simple computational models confirm that environmental feedback generates significant levels of genetic similarity among non-kin within locales. The mechanism is fairly general, and Call under some conditions produce levels of genetic similarity comparable to those resulting from close genealogical relationship. Environmental feedback call also generate the negative assortment necessary for the evolution of spiteful traits. Environmental feedback is expected to create positive frequency-dependent selection, which thus favor any social trait that becomes common in the population. Results from this stylized model suggest that environmental feedback Could lie important in the evolution of both cooperation and spite, within as well as between species.

J	Aghasi, K; Colombo, MG; Rossi-Lamastra, C				Aghasi, Keivan; Colombo, Massimo G.; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina			Acquisitions of small high-tech firms as a mechanism for external knowledge sourcing: The integration-autonomy dilemma	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE												Acquisitions of small high-tech firms by large incumbents are a prominent mechanism for external knowledge sourcing, whose success strictly depends on the choice of a wise post-acquisition implementation strategy. This paper theoretically discusses and empirically documents - on a sample of 458 deals in the 20012005 period - the antecedents of this choice by focusing on the integration-autonomy dilemma. Specifically, we jointly consider two main dimensions of the post-acquisition implementation: whether the acquiring firm absorbs the acquired one into its organization or keeps it separate as an autonomous subsidiary/business unit and whether the acquired.CEO is replaced or retained. Separation with CEO retention corresponds to the minimum level of integration (and the maximum level of autonomy), whereas absorption with CEO replacement corresponds to the maximum level of integration (and the minimum level of autonomy.) We hypothesize that the acquiring firm chooses an implementation strategy with high level of integration when the acquired firm produces a component technology or operates in a related market. Indeed, in both cases, the interdependency between the two firms is high and thus the benefits of integration likely exceed the costs of the loss of autonomy. However, this positive association is weaker when the acquiring and acquired firms have common ground, originating from technological relatedness or prior alliances, which acts as a low-cost coordination mechanism. Results of econometric estimates largely confirm our hypotheses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
