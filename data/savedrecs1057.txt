Algorithms for automatic tag disambiguation need "golden" collections of manually created tags to establish baselines for accuracy assessment. Here we show how to use the MIRFLICKR-25000 collection to evaluate the performance of our algorithm for tag sense disambiguation which identifies meanings of image tags based on WordNet or Wikipedia. We present three different types of observations on the disambiguated tags: (i) accuracy evaluation, (ii) evaluation of the semantic similarity of the individual tags with the image category and (iii) the semantic similarity of an image tagset to the image category, using different word embedding models for the latter two. We show how word embeddings create a specific baseline so the results can be compared. The accuracy we achieve is 78.6%.

Doug			Revisiting Marshall's Agglomeration Economies: Technological Relatedness and the Evolution of the Sheffield Metals Cluster	REGIONAL STUDIES												According to Alfred Marshall, firms receive increasing returns from a trinity of agglomeration economies: a local pool of skilled labour, local supplier linkages and local knowledge spillovers. This article re-examines the mechanisms underlying Marshall's agglomeration economies in the Sheffield metals cluster wherein Marshall discovered them. Despite the cluster's decline, empirical evidence is found that the mechanisms underlying Marshallian agglomeration economies continue to occur within the surviving metals industry. However, upon closer examination, Marshallian agglomeration economies have evolved to become more prevalent amongst plants that use related metals technology. The results highlight the importance of technological relatedness to cluster survival.

Our point of departure is a harmonic mixing method for musical mashups by Bernardes et al. [1]. To surpass design limitations identified in the previous method, we propose a new interactive visualisation of multidimensional musical attributes-hierarchical harmonic compatibility, onset density, spectral region, and timbral similarity-extracted from a large collection of audio tracks. All tracks are represented as nodes whose distances and edge connections indicate their harmonic compatibility as a result of a force-directed graph. In addition, we provide a visual language that aims to enhance the tool usability and foster creative endeavour in the search for meaningful music mixes.

J	Kuusk, K				Kuusk, Kadri			Regional differences in how related variety 'works': the case of labour mobility	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES												The benefits of related variety on regional employment growth have become a prevailing view. However, these remain potential benefits unless channels (e.g. labour flows, inter-firm cooperation) and regional capabilities are in place to convert them into actual growth. This paper focuses on the labour mobility channel and proposes a way to measure the realized part of related variety. It demonstrates that in Sweden, core regions make ten times more use of their related variety potential via labour mobility than small, peripheral regions. Moreover, even in core and large regions only a handful of potential ties are realized. Most firms in small regions must rely on other channels to convert related variety potential into growth. Furthermore, while local labour flows between related industries are associated with higher employment growth, no evidence is found that, on average, other channels bring growth benefits in small regions. Thus, the paper argues that the role of market-mediated knowledge flow channels like labour mobility is underestimated compared to pure spillovers via unintended interactions. Consequently, it is important to go beyond assuming that the benefits of related variety are 'in the air' or in local 'buzz' and focus on specific channels at work.																			0965-4313	1469-5944				OCT 3	2021	29	10					1951	1973		10.1080/09654313.2021.1903398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09654313.2021.1903398		MAR 2021											WOS:000634548300001

In this paper we provide further details on the experimental support and discussion of these methods. Given two nouns, in the first method the similarity is measured by the relative size of the intersection of the sets of modifiers applicable to both of them. In the second method, the dissimilarity is measured by the difference between the mean values of cohesion between a noun and the two sets of modifiers: its own ones and those of the other noun in question. Here, the cohesion between words is measured via Web statistics for co-occurrences of words. The two proposed measures prove to be in approximately inverse dependency. Our experiments show that Web-based weighting (the second method) gives better results.

This is unfortunate because both streams of literature have a lot to offer each other. This paper explores how, looking at four strands in the GVC literature. Promising crossovers between EEG and the GVC literature are identified, but also some missing links that need to be taken up in future research. These new research avenues, promoting the adoption of an evolutionary perspective on GVCs, are expected to enrich both literatures in mutual ways.																			2379-2949	2379-2957				APR 3	2022	7	2					123	146		10.1080/23792949.2022.2040371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23792949.2022.2040371		MAR 2022											WOS:000780466500001

Impact of Population Substructure on Trend Tests for Genetic Case-Control Association Studies	BIOMETRICS												P>Hidden population substructure in case-control data has the potential to distort the performance of Cochran-Armitage trend tests (CATTs) for genetic associations. Three possible scenarios that may arise are investigated here: (i) heterogeneity of genotype frequencies across unidentified subpopulations (PSI), (ii) heterogeneity of genotype frequencies and disease risk across unidentified subpopulations (PSII), and (iii) cryptic correlations within unidentified subpopulations. A unified approach is presented for deriving the bias and variance distortion under the three scenarios for any CATT in a general family. Using these analytical formulas, we evaluate the excess type I errors of the CATTs numerically in the presence of population substructure. Our results provide insight into the properties of some proposed corrections for bias and variance distortion and show why they may not fully correct for the effects of population substructure.																			0006-341X	1541-0420				MAR	2010	66	1					196	204		10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01264.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01264.x								19432788					WOS:000275727200023

Our general hypothesis is twofold: (1) There exists patterns in the relationship between problems and solutions and there should be data or a body of knowledge that describes how problems and solutions relate; and (2) the identification, manipulation, and learning of such patterns through case features can help create and reuse explanations for solutions produced by the target method. When the target method relies on neural network architectures (e.g., deep learning), the resulting latent space (i.e., word embeddings) becomes useful for finding patterns and semantic relatedness in textual data. In the proposed approach, case problems are input-output pairs from the target method, and case solutions are explanations. We exemplify our approach by explaining recommended citations from Citeomatic - a multi-layer neural-network architecture from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Citation analysis is the body of knowledge that describes how query documents (i.e., inputs) relate to recommended citations (i.e., outputs). We build cases and similarity assessment to learn features that represent patterns between problems and solutions that can lead to the reuse of corresponding explanations. The illustrative implementation we present becomes an explanation-augmented citation recommender that targets human-computer trust.

However, given the complexities in many economies of the world today, it is important to reassess the ecological concerns of these factors in light of the Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Therefore, this current study investigates the global assessment using data from World Bank Development database from 1995 to 2016. Evidence from the method employed, sys-GMM, revealed that the economic complexities index increases the carbon emission in low-income groups while it significantly decreases the carbon emission for upper-middle and high-income groups. For the combined group, the EKC hypothesis holds, and ECI significantly hampers carbon emissions. For the other variables, it is worthy of note that (1) economic growth contributes to the high carbon contents across the income group especially for low-income, upper-middle-income and high-income group; (2) the effects of air transport on carbon emission is positive for lower-middle-income and high-income group and negative for the upper-middle-income group; (3) the use of coal rents and energy use leads to high release of carbon contents across all the income groups; and (4) a significant increase in the utilization of energy leads to increase in carbon contents except for lower-income group, it leads to a decrease. From this empirical assessment, vital energy policy directions are suggested.

Through the lens of social change and human development theory, heavily constructed in the Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft paradigm, this focused ethnography explored the push and pull of traditional boundaries within a collectivist society. Participants in this study (N = 24) were members of eight family triads of grandmothers, mothers, and daughters who represented eight different Emirati tribes from four cities in the UAE. Data were collected during semi-structured interviews using prompts and vignettes and through observation and the generation of field notes. Thematic analysis revealed evidence of cultural value change for gender equity and roles, family connectedness, and family relatedness. The findings underscore the need to support Emirati women as they navigate value change and try to rectify often conflicting role expectations.																			2331-1886					DEC 31	2023	9	1							2184899	10.1080/23311886.2023.2184899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2023.2184899													WOS:000943485500001

This study makes it possible to determine the hi-tech spheres in which the entrepreneurship is going to develop more successfully. The purpose of the investigation is to determine the technological proximity of the industrial production branches with the high-tech economy sector for further defining the egress from the previous development path. Design/methodology/approach: In order to determine possible egress of the region from the previous development trajectory there has been proposed a method of proximity evaluation between the high-tech sector and the existing structure of industrial production in the region. The characteristics of high technologies relatedness to other industry branches in the Russian regions have been defined. Findings: For the Russian regions it was determined that less than 30% of sub-branches can be considered as connected with the high technology sector - 25%. The regions having the comparative advantages in the high-tech types of industry and sectors related thereto have been revealed. We have demonstrated that individual regions can progress through investment into interregional connections and entrepreneurship domestic innovations. Research/practical implications: Considered as the investigatory contribution of the paper can be the alternative proposed to the comparative advantage index in the form of a localization coefficient to be used at evaluation of the technological proximity of industrial branches. The results of this study can be of benefit to representatives of the regional managerial bodies in the course of the economic policy development in the sphere of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: Proposed in the article is a method for evaluation of technological proximity of industry branches which differs from the traditional use of the localization coefficient. The calculated proximity indexes make it possible to determine such high-tech industries to the development of which there are the necessary prerequisites in the region, i.e. the technologically similar industrial production is under development.

J	Lessard, S				Lessard, Sabin			Effective Game Matrix and Inclusive Payoff in Group-Structured Populations	DYNAMIC GAMES AND APPLICATIONS												We show that a matrix game within groups in a finite-island model is effectively equivalent to a matrix game in a well-mixed population. The effective game matrix is a sum of interaction effects minus competition effects, weighted by identity measures involving up to three individuals. These identity measures are computed in the absence of selection but depend on the selection regime and the dispersal pattern: differential viability or fertility, hard selection or soft selection, uniform dispersal or local extinction followed by uniform recolonization. Hard selection, which allows for group selection, understood as differential contributions of groups, reduces competition within groups compared to soft selection. Moreover, the reduction is more pronounced in the case of uniform dispersal than in the case of local extinction. Fertility differences add competition effects between an individual and itself. A personal inclusive payoff can be defined from the effective game matrix and used to predict the increase or decrease in frequency of a mutant strategy. However, this personal inclusive payoff is generally frequency-dependent and its mean does not necessarily increase over time.																			2153-0785	2153-0793				JUN	2011	1	2					301	318		10.1007/s13235-011-0014-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13235-011-0014-7													WOS:000208819100005

One hundred and sixty-five high school students (46.7% females; M-age = 14.0 +/- 1.1 years old) from six pre-established classes were cluster-randomly assigned into the experimental (n = 108) or control groups (n = 57). Both groups carried out a six-week intervention program (two Physical Education lessons a week). The experimental group followed the Sport Education model, while the control group methodology was based on direct instruction. Results of the Multilevel Linear Model showed that there were no significant differences in students' sociometric indices nor sociometric status from a macro-analysis perspective. However, the results of the McNemar's test and the visual analysis of social networks within-teams in the experimental group showed that the students' relationships changed favorably within-team after the Sport Education program increased positive nominations and reduced negative nominations. In conclusion, these results suggest that the Sport Education model facilitates initiating new positive social relationships and removing negative relationships in within-team students.

Approaches in the literature consider either independent linking of individual mentions or collective linking of all mentions. Regardless of this distinction, most approaches rely on the Wikipedia encyclopedic KB in order to improve the linking quality, by exploiting its entity descriptions (web pages) or its entity interconnections (hyperlink graph of web pages). In this paper, we devise a novel collective linking technique which departs from most approaches in the literature by relying on a structured RDF KB. This allows exploiting the semantics of the interrelationships that candidate entities may have at disambiguation time rather than relying on raw structural approximation based on Wikipedia's hyperlink graph. The few approaches that also use an RDF KB simply rely on the existence of a relation between the candidate entities to which mentions may be linked. Instead, we weight such relations based on the RDF KB structure and propose an efficient decoding strategy for collective linking. Experiments on standard benchmarks show significant improvement over the state of the art.																					978-1-4503-6887-2				2019										10.1145/3342558.3345393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3342558.3345393													WOS:000558062400008
J	Ayiran, N				Ayiran, Nezih			ARCHITECTURAL CONTINUITY TOWARDS CULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY IN BODRUM	OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL												Mediterranean architecture is considered the predecessor of the modern concept of "bioclimatic" sustainable design due to its climate reactive attitude (Coch H. 1996, Vissilia, A.M. 2009). Another aspect which renders it to be associated with the notion of modern sustainability is the employment of recyclable materials such as natural stone and wood. The vernacular architecture of Bodrum peninsula located in southwestern Turkey bears the typical characteristics of Mediterranean architecture. Since the 1970s, Bodrum has been attracting the attention of local and foreign tourists. The "architectural pollution" created by tourism facilities paradoxically devastates the natural and unique architectural characteristics of Bodrum which attract the attention of tourists. In this article, the primary focus will be the residential architecture in Bodrum due to its quite dominant typology among tourism facilities. However, the local building regulations aiming to protect natural values and architectural identity and the sensitive attitudes of some architects about preserving architectural identity and visual ecology can be considered positive aspects with regards to the harmonious architectural development of the region. Visual ecology seems generally more vital than biophysical ecology in terms of sustainable tourism economy, and tourism, is the most important sector in Bodrum. In a touristic region such as Bodrum, cultural and economic sustainability are interrelated. Today, research related to sustainability focuses primarily on energy saving and relevant technological inventions and as a result, issues such as cultural expression, contextual connection, identity formation, local differences and changes do not get their deserved places in the sustainability value setting. This paper aims to detect some clues about the outline of the residential architecture within the context of cultural sustainability in Bodrum in the light of residential architecture samples.																			0168-2601					JUN	2011	36	2					82	96																WOS:000292018400009

Design/methodology/approach: By applying SDT, we developed two measures. The first one assessed the degree to which the three basic human psychological needs motivate farmers to engage in CDP, and the second concerned farmers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to seek knowledge through participation in CDP. Using data from two samples of farmers, we examined the effect of SDT needs and the influence of the different regulatory styles on individuals' decision to participate in CDP. Findings: Our findings indicated that participation inCDP is guided by the most internal forms of human motivation (identified, integrated, and intrinsic motivation), and that deficits in the needs for autonomy and competence predict farmers' decision to participate in CDP. Practical implications: These results stress the importance of designing CDP that promote self-directedness, emphasise choice rather than rewards, and generate the conditions that support farmers' autonomy. Theoretical implications: Our work suggests that the integration of social psychology into extension/education research can paint a more detailed picture of the way farmers interact with extension/education services. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses an SDT framework to examine farmers' motivation toward participation in CDP. Hence, this research opens a new realm for extension/education research, while it also contributes to the SDT literature by examining the role of self-determined motivation in a different life domain.

The findings reveal evidence of a U-shaped structure; meaning, economic growth during the study period under the Norden "Green Deal and Action Plans" impulse remains on a pathway in which environmental quality is not yet improved. Further, there is no leveraging effect that changes the U-shaped structure into and inverted U-shaped. However, Nordic countries are characterized by the existence of the Pollution Halo Effect. Indeed, foreign direct investment inflows lead to increase use of advanced technologies and improved management practices. These results are robust to the use of different techniques such as alternative dependent variables, addition of control variables in response of the likely attrition bias, test of non-belonging to Eurozone features, and quantile analysis. As policy implications, Nordic European countries should amplify environmental management practices and policies to achieve low carbon footprint production or consumption in their economies, as well as pursue on a long-term basis, initiatives for a Green Nordic label, and energy efficiency as settled in the Norden Environmental Action Plan.

J	Gupta, V; Rubalcaba, L				Gupta, Varun; Rubalcaba, Luis			Competency-Industry Relatedness (C-IR) Framework for Sustained Business Growth in Startups during and Beyond Pandemic: Myths and Lessons from Publicly Funded Innovative Startups	SUSTAINABILITY												Context: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a turbulent business environment, resulting in market uncertainties, frustrations, and rumors. Wrongly held beliefs-or myths-can hinder startups from turning new market opportunities into their favor (for example, by failing at diversification decisions) or undertaking wrong business decisions, e.g., diversifying in industries that have products of no real market value). Objectives: The objective of the paper is to identify the beliefs that drive the business decisions of startups in a pandemic and to isolate those beliefs that are merely myths. Further, this paper proposes strategic guidelines in the form of a framework to help startups make sound decisions that can lead to market success. Method: The two-step research method involved multiple case studies with five startups based in India, France, Italy, and Switzerland, to identify perceptual beliefs that drove strategic business decisions, followed by a case study of 36 COVID-19-solution focused startups, funded by the European Union (EU). The findings were validated through a survey that involved 102 entrepreneurs. The comparative analysis of two multiple case studies helped identify beliefs that were merely "myths"; myths that drove irrational strategic decisions, resulting in business failures. Results: The results indicate that startups make decisions in pandemic situations that are driven by seven myths, pertaining to human, intellectual, and financial resources. The decision on whether to diversify or continue in the same business operation can be divided into four strategic options of the Competency-Industry Relatedness (C-IR) framework: ignore, delay, phase-in, and diversify. Diversification in the same (or different industry) is less risky for startups if they have the skills, as needed, to diversify in related industries. Diversification in related industries helps startups leverage their experiences and learning curves (those associated with existing product lines) to adapt their existing products in new markets, or utilize their technologies to solve new problems via new products. The desired outcome for these startups should be sustainable business growth-to meet sustainability goals by contributing to the society and the economy. Conclusion: The C-IR framework is a strategic guide for startups to make business decisions based on internal factors, rather than myths. Accurately assessing skill diversity and the nature of new industries (or markets) will help startups leverage their existing resources optimally, without the need for (pricey) external funding. This will foster sustained business growth resulting in a nation economic development. Knowledge transfer from the Innovation ecosystem will further strengthen the C-IR framework effectiveness.

J	Wang, JQ; Li, S; Li, HZ				Wang, Jianqiao; Li, Sai; Li, Hongzhe			A Regression-Based Approach to Robust Estimation and Inference for Genetic Covariance	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION												Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex traits, and some variants are shown to be associated with multiple complex traits. Genetic covariance between two traits is defined as the underlying covariance of genetic effects and can be used to measure the shared genetic architecture. The data used to estimate such a genetic covariance can be from the same group or different groups of individuals, and the traits can be of different types or collected based on different study designs. This article proposes a unified regression-based approach to robust estimation and inference for genetic covariance of general traits that may be associated with genetic variants nonlinearly. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are provided and are shown to be robust under certain model misspecification. Our method under linear working models provides a robust inference for the narrow-sense genetic covariance, even when both linear models are mis-specified. Numerical experiments are performed to support the theoretical results. Our method is applied to an outbred mice GWAS dataset to study the overlapping genetic effects between the behavioral and physiological phenotypes. The real data results reveal interesting genetic covariance among different mice developmental traits.

Participants were 679 high school students (M-age = 16.16,49.3% girls). The findings supported the additive hypothesis: all three needs had unique effects on autonomous motivation. The synergistic hypothesis was only partially supported: one two-way interaction between autonomy and competence had effect on autonomous motivation. A high level of satisfaction of the need for autonomy led to autonomous motivation regardless of satisfaction of the need for competence. However, competence was positively related to autonomous motivation only when the need for autonomy was low The balance hypothesis was also supported: balance in needs satisfaction had a significant effect in addition to additive and synergistic effects.																			1848-5189	1848-5197					2018	20	2					399	429		10.15516/cje.v20i2.2752	http://dx.doi.org/10.15516/cje.v20i2.2752													WOS:000454544000003
J	Hane-Weijman, E				Hane-Weijman, Emelie			Skill matching and mismatching: labour market trajectories of redundant manufacturing workers	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY												While re-employment opportunities for redundant workers have been a much-debated topic in economic geography, the characteristics of these new employments and the medium-run effect of major lay-offs constitute a less explored field. The present paper investigates skill matching between the pre-redundancy job and the employment workers have five years after redundancy by studying the distance and direction of their labour market trajectories. By following 670 manufacturing workers made redundant in major layoffs in 2003, the present paper connects patterns of career mobility and underemployment to possible frictions connected to spatial and industrial mobility. The results indicate that moving some distance from the initial point of departure is correlated with upward mobility. This especially concerns moving to a related industry in the same region or moving to a new region, but within the same industry. Moving too great a distance, however, increases the risk of downward mobility. Moving to unrelated industries in general, but also to related industries in new regions, is associated with a higher risk of facing underemployment in the medium run. In conclusion, the longer-run labour market trajectories, in relation to both distance and direction, need to be addressed if we are to assess the outcome of redundancies.

However, most of the existing tools require features in propositional form, i.e., a vector of nominal or numerical features associated with an instance, while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature. In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. We evaluate our approach on three different tasks: (i) standard machine learning tasks, (ii) entity and document modeling, and (iii) content-based recommender systems. The evaluation shows that the proposed entity embeddings outperform existing techniques, and that pre-computed feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks.

ON THE SOCIAL AND COGNITIVE DIMENSIONS OF WICKED ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS CHARACTERIZED BY CONCEPTUAL AND SOLUTION UNCERTAINTY	ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS												We develop a quantitative framework for understanding the class of wicked problems that emerge at the intersections of natural, social, and technological complex systems. Wicked problems reflect our incomplete understanding of interdependent global systems and the systemic risk they pose; such problems escape solutions because they are often ill-defined, and thus mis-identified and under-appreciated by communities of problem-solvers. While there are well-documented benefits to tackling boundary-crossing problems from various viewpoints, the integration of diverse approaches can nevertheless contribute confusion around the collective understanding of the core concepts and feasible solutions. We explore this paradox by analyzing the development of both scholarly (social) and topical (cognitive) communities - two facets of knowledge production studies here that contribute towards the evolution of knowledge in and around a problem, termed a knowledge trajectory - associated with three wicked problems: deforestation, invasive species, and wildlife trade. We posit that saturation in the dynamics of social and cognitive diversity growth is an indicator of reduced uncertainty in the evolution of the comprehensive knowledge trajectory emerging around each wicked problem. Informed by comprehensive bibliometric data capturing both social and cognitive dimensions of each problem domain, we thereby develop a framework that assesses the stability of knowledge trajectory dynamics as an indicator of wickedness associated with conceptual and solution uncertainty. As such, our results identify wildlife trade as a wicked problem that may be difficult to address given recent instability in its knowledge trajectory.

J	Liu, HX; Nong, HF; Ren, H; Liu, K				Liu, Hongxiao; Nong, Huifu; Ren, Hai; Liu, Ke			The effect of nature exposure, nature connectedness on mental well-being and ill-being in a general Chinese population	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Exposure to nature is associated with various mental health benefits. Nature connectedness (NC), a psychological construct that measures individuals' subjective sense of connection to nature, is found to influence the relationship between nature exposure and mental health, including well-being and ill-being. However, studies from non-Western cultures have only examined either nature exposure and mental health or NC and mental health, with little research investigating the relationship among all three in a single study. Based on a face-to-face survey in Guangzhou (N = 863), this study investigates the relationship among nature exposure (greenspace visitation frequency, duration, and greenspace accessibility), NC, and mental well-being and ill-being. Based on the results, NC is stronger than nature exposure in predicting mental well-being, while greenspace visitation frequency and duration are stronger than NC in predicting ill-being. Having a higher-than-average NC is associated with a 7% increase in feelings of worthwhileness, a 6.4% increase in life satisfaction, and a 2.5% decrease in depression risk. NC could function as both mediator and moderator, depending on the specific nature exposure-mental health link examined. Future studies are required to understand the complex interaction of nature exposure, NC, and mental health. Our study indicates that a shift in policymaking to enhance NC is recommended to achieve the related psychological benefits. To this end, research on the influencing factors of NC (e.g., characteristics of nature experiences) and effective interventions to cultivate NC are required.					liu, hongxiao/ABI-1862-2020	Ren, Hai/0000-0002-3744-8007; Nong, Huifu/0000-0001-8016-4678													0169-2046	1872-6062				JUN	2022	222								104397	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104397		MAR 2022											WOS:000795155600002

CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH												Evolutionary theories explain altruism between related individuals, not only for nonhuman animals but also humans themselves. In sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, the supposedly universally found stronger matrilineal kin caregiving by grandparents, aunts, and uncles is often explained by paternity uncertainty in the male descent line. The present article provides an overview of theories and results of the evolutionary research. I will focus, in particular, on the universal caregiving pattern as well as on cultural variety in kin caregiving, the role of actual paternity certainty in the society, theoretical inconsistencies, and nonconsanguineous step relationships. From the analysis of the empirical data, I will conclude that the paternity certainty hypothesis is in fact not a very suitable explanation for the asymmetric kin caregiving found in humans. I will discuss how human behavior toward relatives, in particular grandchildren, can be alternatively explained from an evolutionary perspective.																			1069-3971	1552-3578				JUL	2017	51	3	2		SI		263	284		10.1177/1069397117697671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1069397117697671													WOS:000403180300003

Prominence and Engagement: Different Mechanisms Regulating Continuance and Contribution in Online Communities	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS												Online communities have suffered from their members' intermittent, dormant, or nonexistent participation. We propose that prominence, which refers to the salience of community members' psychological proximity to their community, differs from the engagement construct, which denotes a psychological dedication to behave prosaically toward other community members. Whereas engagement has been increasingly examined as a driver of online community behavior, the role of prominence has received a minimal amount of attention in the literature. Drawing on self-determination theory, we developed a framework that proposes the prominence construct as a phenomenon distinctive from engagement in its nature, formation, and behavioral outcomes. Our findings based on two studies indicate that the proposed model with prominence performs considerably better than the existing model with only engagement. Our conceptual model contributes to Information Systems research by laying a strong theoretical foundation to differentiate between the behavioral paths of the autonomous prominence construct and its controlled engagement counterpart.

The Kazakhstani government approached the Russian and Chinese governments intending to join the Western Europe-Western China (WE-WC) initiative to boost the country's regional development. The paper aims to assess how the WE-WC transport corridor affected the economic potential of linking cities and regions starting from the quality of transport infrastructure and leading to their export potential. The study's findings showed that the Kazakhstan section of the WE-WC corridor was at an early stage of transformation from a transport into an economic corridor. While the Russia-Uzbekistan section continues to serve mainly a transit function and operate at the level of transport infrastructure, the China-Kyrgyzstan section has started evolving from the level of multimode transport corridor to the level of logistics corridor. The economic sustainability of the WE-WC linking mining and agricultural regions of Kazakhstan still comes into question and depends on the government's further region-specific policy actions.

Moving beyond conventional approaches in financial geography, we propose a new analytical framework drawing on evolutionary economic geography. We find that China's P2P industry is highly concentrated in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou. These cities have possessed competent financial and Internet sectors before the emergence of P2P industry, and thus provide capabilities that P2P industry could build on. Moreover, experienced entrants, namely new firms founded by pre-existing firms and their employees from technologically related industries, play a crucial role in transferring capabilities from pre-existing financial and Internet capabilities into the P2P industry. In addition, the emergence of the P2P industry experienced three stages characterized by constraining environments with uncertainty coming from customers (2007-2012), enabling environments with inclusive regulations (2013-2015), and constraining environments with tight regulations (2016-2019).

J	Mizielinska, J				Mizielinska, Joanna			"Is She Still a Family or Rather Some Stranger?" - Relative Strangers and Kinship Plasticity in <i>Families of Choice in Poland</i>	JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY												In the paper, I draw on the data from the ethnographic part of my recently completed research project "Families of Choice in Poland" (2013-2016). I focus on queer families' ways of describing their kin-relations and the meaning of "families". This often involves strategic use of kin language and reference to the importance of blood relations. Analysis reveals a high degree of polemic interplays and ambivalences, especially in reference to the role of social mother within lesbian families. In their narratives lesbian mothers and their children struggle between the biogenetic normative understanding of the family and the practical one based on parental practices of care and shared affections. By investigating the family maps of participants I aim to demonstrate what kind of relatedness matters to them, how it is (re)negotiated and changed. By doing this, I intend to show that queer kinship is always already very plastic, based on contradictions between choice and blood. Blood as an important symbol of kinship is affirmed and simultaneously challenged because biology ceased to be a singular self-evident and natural fundament of kinship.																			0091-8369	1540-3602				SEP 19	2021	68	11					1899	1922		10.1080/00918369.2020.1712143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2020.1712143		JAN 2020						31939713					WOS:000507220700001

CompositeView: A Network-Based Visualization Tool	BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING												Large networks are quintessential to bioinformatics, knowledge graphs, social network analysis, and graph-based learning. CompositeView is a Python-based open-source application that improves interactive complex network visualization and extraction of actionable insight. CompositeView utilizes specifically formatted input data to calculate composite scores and display them using the Cytoscape component of Dash. Composite scores are defined representations of smaller sets of conceptually similar data that, when combined, generate a single score to reduce information overload. Visualized interactive results are user-refined via filtering elements such as node value and edge weight sliders and graph manipulation options (e.g., node color and layout spread). The primary difference between CompositeView and other network visualization tools is its ability to auto-calculate and auto-update composite scores as the user interactively filters or aggregates data. CompositeView was developed to visualize network relevance rankings, but it performs well with non-network data. Three disparate CompositeView use cases are shown: relevance rankings from SemNet 2.0, an open-source knowledge graph relationship ranking software for biomedical literature-based discovery; Human Development Index (HDI) data; and the Framingham cardiovascular study. CompositeView was stress tested to construct reference benchmarks that define breadth and size of data effectively visualized. Finally, CompositeView is compared to Excel, Tableau, Cytoscape, neo4j, NodeXL, and Gephi.

Counting Bees: Learning Outcomes from Participation in the Dutch National Bee Survey	SUSTAINABILITY												Citizen science approaches to data collection are growing in popularity, in part because of their potential for achieving both scientific and educational objectives. Evaluating the impacts of participation on citizen scientists is important, yet such evaluations are still relatively rare. In addition, recent literature reviews indicate that existing studies often focus on content learning, make limited use of existing scales, and rarely report null results. This paper reports an evaluation of the demographic profile, motivations and learning outcomes of participants in the Dutch National Bee Survey, a national-scale citizen science project involving citizens in collecting observational data of wild bees. Using a repeated measures survey study, we assessed the impact of participation on respondents' attitudes and behavioural intentions regarding bees, and their attitudes towards nature, citizenship, and citizen science. Our baseline (N = 373) and follow-up (N = 208) surveys indicate that our respondents are of a relatively high age and education level, have a pre-existing affinity with nature, and are strongly motivated by conservation concerns and learning about bees. Assessment of learning outcomes indicated a significant difference between two types of self-report questions: respondents reported significant gains in knowledge and appreciation of wild bees, yet attitudinal scales indicated no significant shifts in attitudes towards bees, nature, citizen science, or citizenship. In our discussion, we suggest several explanations for this finding, including respondents' pre-existing affinity with nature, and advance suggestions for future research into citizen science learning outcomes.					van den Born, Riyan J.G./B-3421-2017	Ganzevoort, Wessel/0000-0002-1421-9893														2071-1050				MAY	2021	13	9							4703	10.3390/su13094703	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13094703													WOS:000650880300001

Based on self-determination theory, our approach investigates the intermediate role of employees' curiosity in the relationships between inherent psychological needs and employees' creative use of IT. By using the quantitative method, this study develops a model regarding the creative use of IT. To test the model, surveys are distributed to employees working for organizations located in one of the biggest city in Vietnam. The results indicate that curiosity has partial mediation in the relation between inherent psychological needs and creative use of IT. The findings of this paper are expected to shed a new light into the study of users' behavior, especially in their creative use of IT. This paper also provides valuable insight to practitioners on how to improve their employees' creative use of IT.

As online courses become prevalent during the present pandemic caused by COVID-19, it is very important to search for the answers to the following questions: How can instructors design their online courses to optimize student motivation? And how can students identify and take advantage of motivational strengths in online courses? The modified version of the Motivation to Learn Online Questionnaire (MLOQ) was used to assess college students' motivation to learn during online classes. The MLOQ is adapted, in part, from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and it was designed to assess the following dimensions: intrinsic and extrinsic goal orientation, self-efficacy and task value. These factors are based on a general cognitive view of motivation and are well-documented as influencing the quality of instruction in a traditional classroom, but they might function differently in online learning environments. Two other constructs: instructor support and social engagement are part of the MLOQ since they are relevant to the motivation to learn online. The sample consists of 184 university students recruited from 30 different online courses taught at two private universities in Skopje, the International Balkan University and University American College Skopje. Results from the confirmatory factor analysis show that the hypothesized 6-factor model has an acceptable fit to the data from this research and it can be considered when determining the optimal approach to online learning.

J	Bergamini, E; Zachmann, G				Bergamini, Enrico; Zachmann, Georg			Exploring EU's Regional Potential in Low-Carbon Technologies	SUSTAINABILITY												This research builds on the regional innovation literature, and aims to better understand the potential for, and development of, low-carbon technologies in the European Union. Exploiting the OECD's REGPAT for regionalised patent data, we estimate the potential advantage of European NUTS2 regions have in 14 green technologies. We use network proximity between technologies and between regions to understand technological/regional clusters of revealed technological advantage and build the regressors for estimating regional potential advantage in specific technologies via zero-inflated beta regressions. Based on this, we explore the region-technology networks, finding two gravity centres for green innovation in France's and Germany's industrial and high-tech hubs (ile de France, Stuttgart, and Oberbayern). We also construct a dataset of lagged potentials and labour market, economic and demographic variables, and perform an elastic net regularisation to understand the association with current revealed advantages. Our approach indicates an association between technological advantage in green technologies and the (lags of) participation rates in labour markets, sectoral employment in science and technology, general higher education, duration of employment, percentage of GDP spent on R&D (public and private) and other expenditure on R&D. If confirmed by causality tests, the established associations could help in designing horizontal economic policies to enable specific regions to realise their specialisation potential in specific green technologies.																				2071-1050				JAN	2021	13	1							32	10.3390/su13010032	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13010032													WOS:000606435700001
J	Signori, A; Vismara, S				Signori, Andrea; Vismara, Silvio			M & A synergies and trends in IPOs	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE												The recent decline in IPO activity can be explained by the small firms' increasing preference for being acquired rather than growing independently. This paper sheds light on this explanation by focusing on the nature of the firms facing this decision and their potential merger synergies. First, the above explanation should be particularly true for Young Innovative Companies (YICs), which are often superior to incumbents in originating innovations but face greater difficulties in bringing them to the market. Second, a firm's trade-off between being acquired and remaining independent strongly depends on the extent of the synergies arising from a potential merger, which are however difficult to assess ex-ante. Using a new, text-based measure of business similarity as a proxy for M & A synergies, we document that YICs facing the potential to develop larger synergies are the main responsible for the decline in IPOs. Compared to 15 years ago, the quarterly number of IPOs conducted by these firms has decreased by 20. At the same time, while M & A activity of other firms has declined, the number of acquisitions involving this particular type of firms has remained stable over time.

Our theoretical development builds upon two psychological theories, namely self-determination and psychological ownership, to identify five psychological needs (needs for autonomy, relatedness, competence, having a place, and self-identity), that we posit are particularly pertinent to social media use. According to NAF, these psychological needs will motivate use of those social media applications that provide salient affordances to fulfill these needs. We identify such affordances through a comprehensive review of the literature and of social media applications and put forth propositions that map the affordances to the psychological needs that they fulfill. Our theory development generates important implications. First, it has implications for social media research in that it provides an overarching comprehensive framework for the affordances of social media as a whole and the related psychological needs that motivate their use. Future studies can leverage NAF to identify psychological needs motivating the use of specific social media sites based on the affordances the sites provide, and design science research can leverage NAF in the design and bundling of specific social media features to engage users. Second, it has implications for technology acceptance research in that NAF can enrich existing models by opening up the mechanisms through which psychological needs influence user perceptions of social media and their use patterns and behaviors. Finally, NAF provides a new lens and common vocabulary for future studies, which we hope can stimulate cumulative research endeavors to develop a comprehensive framework of information systems affordances in general and the psychological needs that information systems satisfy.																			0276-7783					SEP	2018	42	3					737	+		10.25300/MISQ/2018/11492	http://dx.doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2018/11492													WOS:000464639000003

Species abundance as a determinant of aesthetic values of flowering plant communities	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												Both the conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of ecosystem services are important and fundamental goals in response to the current biodiversity crisis. Cultural ecosystem services - the non-material benefits people derive from their interactions with nature - are an important component of ecosystem services. However, determining the contributions of different components of biodiversity to these benefits has proven more challenging than for other ecosystem services. Here, we determine the relative contributions of diversity (measured as cultivar richness) and abundance (number of individuals) to the aesthetic value of flowering plant communities, using sunflowers as a model organism. We created grassland vegetation plots consisting of different numbers of sunflower cultivars and individuals, presented these treatments to people, and measured their aesthetic preferences (both self-reported and objective behavioural measures) towards them. We found that people's aesthetic preferences were unrelated to differences in the cultivar richness of the plots but increased substantially with the number of individuals. More importantly, these preference patterns did not differ with a participants' nature orientation, ecological knowledge, or gender, suggesting the generality of the results. Our findings indicate that the abundance of wildlife can play a crucial role in shaping the cultural services provided by ecosystems. Researchers and policy-makers should therefore pay more attention to the role of abundance in maintaining ecosystem services.																			1618-8667	1610-8167				AUG	2021	63								127194	10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127194		MAY 2021											WOS:000684011700007
J	Kardas, F; Yalçin, I				Kardas, Ferhat; Yalcin, Ilhan			An Adaptation Study of the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (BMPN) Scale to Turkish Culture	CUKUROVA UNIVERSITY FACULTY OF EDUCATION JOURNAL												Psychological needs have long been one of the most widely studied topics in the field of mental health. One of the commonly used approaches in recent years in psychological needs satisfaction research is self-determination theory. It is stated in the frame of self-determination theory that psychological needs are universal and can be classified as needs in terms of competence, relationship and autonomy. The aim of this study is to adapt the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (BMPN) Scale, which was developed to measure the satisfaction level within the framework of self-determination theory, to Turkish culture. After examining the related literature, a validity and reliability study of the BMPN Scale has been carried out on the students of the Faculty of Educational Sciences of Ankara University, and on the pedagogical formation students from other faculties. Confirmatory factor analysis in the study was conducted on 285 students, criterion related validity on 282 and test re-test reliability on 50 students. 80.5% of the respondents were female and 19.5% were male. The average age of participants was 22. As a result of the research, it was determined that the psychometric properties of the scale were adequate, and the model fit values were appropriate. Accordingly, the Turkish form of BMPN was considered a valid and reliable measurement tool that can be used in research on needs satisfaction.

Construction of such a parser is difficult in the case of inflective languages with relaxed word order like Polish. The goal of the work presented here is to analyse the extent of knowledge that call be expressed in the form of morphosyntactic constraints referring to morphological properties of word forms, and its applications in the automatic extraction of syntactic and semantic knowledge. Basic properties of all extended version of the language of morphosyntactic constraints called JOSKIPI are briefly presented. The application of morphosyntactic constraints as background knowledge for extraction of disambiguation rules for Polish is discussed. A new approach to extraction of lexical semantic relations is presented: it relies oil the constraints in identifying lexico-morphosyntactic dependencies among word forms in the text. Finally, a combination of the constraints and statistical analysis in the acquisition of multiword expressions is outlined.

J	Yamashita, M; Mullin, TJ; Safarina, S				Yamashita, Makoto; Mullin, Tim J.; Safarina, Sena			An efficient second-order cone programming approach for optimal selection in tree breeding	OPTIMIZATION LETTERS												It is common in forest tree breeding that selection of populations must consider conservation of genetic diversity, while at the same time attempting to maximize response to selection. To optimize selection in these situations, the constraint on genetic diversity can be mathematically described with the numerator relationship matrix as a quadratic constraint. Pong-Wong and Woolliams formulated the optimal selection problem using semidefinite programming (SDP). Their SDP approach gave an accurate optimal value, but required rather long computation time. In this paper, we propose an second-order cone programming (SOCP) approach to reduce the heavy computation cost. First, we demonstrate that a simple SOCP formulation achieves the same numerical solution as the SDP approach. A simple SOCP formulation is, however, not much more efficient compared to the SDP approach, so we focused on the sparsity structure of the numerator relationship matrix, and we develop a more efficient SOCP formulation using Henderson's algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed formulation, which we call a compact SOCP, greatly reduced computation time. In a case study, an optimal selection problem that demanded 39,200s under the SDP approach was solved in less than 2s by the compact SOCP formulation. The proposed approach is now available as a part of the software package OPSEL.

The main proposition is that polycentric systems are the emergent outcome of the interactions between three dimensions of polycentricity: morphological, functional and institutional. The focus is on the Dutch-Belgian Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) port-industrial region: one of the world's largest concentrations of oil refining and petrochemical activity. The central question is to what extent is the ARA region a polycentric system and what explains this observed polycentricity? Our analyses demonstrate a high degree of morphological and functional polycentricity with each of the constituent (firms located in) ports connected through flows and specialization in processing and trading oil (products). However, this is not the intended result of formalized spatial planning, nor did the ARA ever became a frame of reference among planning agencies. Rather, it is the result of self-organization in the oil industry that has culminated in the emergence of the ARA as an internationally recognized spot market, later institutionally formalized in delivery contracts (oil futures) traded on international commodity exchanges. We conclude that polycentric systems could be understood as emergent systems that obtained generative capacities, in turn influencing its different constituting dimensions.

Citizen satisfaction index is a plausible mechanism for public policy makers to monitor and evaluate the public policies. While surveys on citizen satisfaction are common among agile and progressive public administration and governments, automating the computation of citizen's' satisfaction is challenging. Given that surveys and evaluations related to citizen satisfaction are retrospective, remedial actions when necessary are always somewhat late.

The rarity of direct experiences of nature in an urban population	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												As people live more urbanised lifestyles there is potential to lose daily contact with nature, diminishing access to the wide range of associated health benefits of interacting with nature. Experiences of nature vary widely across populations, but this variation is poorly understood. We surveyed 1023 residents of an urban population in the UK to measure four distinctly different nature interactions: indirect (viewing nature through a window at work and at home), incidental (spending time outside at work), intentional. (time spent in private gardens) and intentional (time spent in public parks). Scaled-up to the whole study population, accumulation curves of the total number of hours per week that people were exposed to each type of nature interaction showed that 75% of nature interactions were experienced by half the population. Moreover, 75% of the interactions of a type where people were actually present in nature were experienced by just 32% of the population. The average hours each individual experienced nature per week varied across interactions: indirect (46.0 +/- 27.3 SD), incidental (6.4 +/- 12.7 SD), intentional gardens (2.5 +/- 2.9 SD) and intentional-parks (2.3 +/- 2.7 SD). Experiencing nature regularly appears to be the exception rather than the norm, with a person's connection to nature being positively associated with incidental and intentional experiences. This novel study provides baseline information regarding how an urban population experiences different types of nature. Deconstructing nature experience will pave the way for developing recommendations for targeted health outcomes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the original OTCE metric that requires evaluating the empirical transferability on auxiliary tasks, our metrics are auxiliary-free such that they can be computed much more efficiently. Specifically, F-OTCE estimates transferability by first solving an optimal transport (OT) problem between source and target distributions and then uses the optimal coupling to compute the negative conditional entropy (NCE) between the source and target labels. It can also serve as an objective function to enhance downstream transfer learning tasks including model finetuning and domain generalization (DG). Meanwhile, JC-OTCE improves the transferability accuracy of F-OTCE by including label distances in the OT problem, though it incurs additional computation costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-OTCE and JC-OTCE outperform state-of-the-art auxiliary-free metrics by 21.1% and 25.8% , respectively, in correlation coefficient with the ground-truth transfer accuracy. By eliminating the training cost of auxiliary tasks, the two metrics reduce the total computation time of the previous method from 43 min to 9.32 and 10.78 s, respectively, for a pair of tasks.

To save the future of our planet, a transition to a more sustainable urban life is a must. However, there is no single sustainable city model because cities differ in terms of their assets. Hence, locally customized sustainable actions linked to global sustainability should be developed, such as a change in individual behaviors leads to a sustainable society, city, and country. This research investigated green citizen profiles and variables affecting the profiles in the context of environmental behavior and sustainability. For this purpose, survey research was done at the household level in a metropolis in Turkey. Measurement scales about environmental concern, human-nature connections, and sustainable consumption behavior were used for collecting data. A data analysis approach was proposed as the survey dataset contains mixed-type variables. It amalgamates statistics with machine learning algorithms, namely two-stage clustering with multilayered self-organizing maps, k-medoid clustering algorithm, factor analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis and classification and regression trees algorithm. The results reveal that (i) five distinct profiles, namely unconscious greens, risky greens, economic greens, potential greens, and wasters are identified, none of which is entirely green; (ii) district, family life-cycle, household size, number of rooms, altruistic and biocentric environmental concerns are the most critical variables in distinguishing profiles; (iii) the proposed approach enables processing socio-demographic, psychographic, behavioral and consumption variables together.					petricli, gulcan/JCN-8103-2023; Emel, Gul Gokay/AAH-5172-2021														1364-0321	1879-0690				JAN	2024	189		A						113957	10.1016/j.rser.2023.113957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.113957		OCT 2023											WOS:001102603600001

In this article, we propose a method using WordNet 3.1 to determine the similarity based on feature combinations. This work focuses on overcoming the ambiguity in social media text via the selection of informative features to improve semantic representation. In addition, this research uses social media as its research domain used in this work, and the study is only limited to the politic dataset. A feature-based method is applied to predict the outcome and improve the performance of the proposed method depending on factors related to the fidelity, continuity, and balance of knowledge sources in WordNet 3.1. Semantic similarity measurements among words are insufficient and unbalanced features. However, this study presents a semantic similarity measure of a feature-based method in WordNet 3.1 to determine the similarity between two concepts/words depending on the selected features used to measure their similarity, which is also known as a "noun" and "is-a" relations-based method. We evaluate our proposed method using the data set in Agirre [1] (AG203) and compare our results of our new method as which three of methods taxonomy relation, non-taxonomy and Glosses with those of related studies. The correlation with human judgments is subjective and low based on our results was a better. Experimental results show that our new method significantly outperforms other existing computational methods with the following results: r = 0.73%, p = 0.69%, m = 0.71% and nonzero = 0.95%.

The impact of urbanisation on nature dose and the implications for human health	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The last 100 years have seen a huge change in the global structure of the human population, with the majority of people now living in urban rather than rural environments. An assumed consequence is that people will have fewer experiences of nature, and this could have important consequences given the myriad health benefits that they can gain from such experiences. Alternatively, as experiences of nature become rarer, people might be more likely actively to seek them out, mitigating the negative effects of urbanisation. In this study, we used data for 3000 survey respondents from across the UK, and a nature-dose framework, to determine whether (a) increasing urbanisation is associated with a decrease in the frequency, duration and intensity of nature dose; and (b) differences in nature exposure associated with urbanisation impact on four population health outcomes (depression, self-reported health, social cohesion and physical activity). We found negative exponential relationships between nature dose and the degree of urbanisation. The frequency and duration of dose decreased from rural to suburban environments, followed by little change with further increases in urbanisation. There were weak but positive associations between frequency and duration of dose across all four health domains, while different dimensions of dose showed more positive associations with specific health domains in towns and cities. We show that people in urban areas with a low nature dose tend to have worse health across multiple domains, but have the potential for the greatest gains from spending longer in nature, or living in green areas.

Events are represented as components mapped into R-N each consisting of sets of attributes and reliabilities of the sources. These components can pertain to an event description, temporal entities, location, person/agent involved, and objects involved in the event. The application of this research is be able to identify a significant societal event and then extract event threads extending both forward and backward in time and link them by their semantic relationships. Information measures based on algebraic topology use simplicial complexes to identify important threads from the less important spin-off threads and disjoint threads or events. Interactions of event threads are discussed.																					978-1-4673-6213-9; 978-1-4673-6214-6				2013							122	128																WOS:000327025200028

Contributing to this goal, the current study aimed to examine the relationships between one kind of athlete well-being, namely state organic self-talk, and personality traits and the basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration within their sport. Athletes (n = 691; mean age 21.65) from a variety of individual (n = 270) and team sports (n = 421) completed a multi-section questionnaire capturing the targeted variables. Three-step hierarchical regression analyses revealed the following: In step 1, all personality traits were to some extent a significant predictor of athletes' organic, spontaneous self-talk dimensions and goal-directed self-talk functions. In step 2, need satisfaction significantly contributed to all spontaneous self-talk dimensions and goal-directed self-talk functions (except for creating functional deactivated states) over and above personality. Finally, in step 3, need frustration significantly contributed to negative spontaneous self-talk dimensions and to all goal-directed self-talk functions (except for instruction) over and above personality and need satisfaction. Overall, our results indicate the importance of personality traits as personal antecedents, and perceptions of basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration as social-environmental antecedents in shaping athletes' state organic self-talk.

J	Bashan, A; Notea, A				Bashan, Aviva; Notea, Amos			A hierarchical model for quality management systems in global organizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT												Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the operations of the quality management systems (QMS) in multinational companies, and develop a framework for classifying the QMS features based on the global operational and marketing structures arising from their expansion process. This paper is based on doctoral research conducted at the Department of Statistics, University of Haifa, Israel in 2007-2015. Design/methodology/approach This study used the innovative approach of adopting a systems perspective in analyzing the operation of a global QMS. In total 18 multinational companies at different levels of global expansion were studied in depth using observations, longitudinal studies, content analyses and depth interviews. Findings The result of this study is the global hierarchical model (GHM) that presents a classification of representative global operational and marketing structures deriving from the expansion process of multinational companies, and the extrapolated features of the respective global QMS. Practical implications This classification serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying the proper globalization level of a QMS, thereby helping plan global quality strategy and identifying the steps necessary for its effective implementation. Originality/value This research seeks to fill a lacuna in the field of global quality system development with regard to modes of competition and challenge. Integration of strategic, operational and marketing rationales into the QMS's processes augments the functional level of management and supports the development of a strategy for global quality management that is derived from and supports the company's global strategy.																			0265-671X	1758-6682					2018	35	7					1380	1398		10.1108/IJQRM-03-2017-0055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJQRM-03-2017-0055													WOS:000438741500005
J	Bashan, A; Kordova, S				Bashan, Aviva; Kordova, Sigal			Challenges in regulating the local and global needs of quality management systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT												Purpose The complex processes of global organizations poses significant challenges for the global quality management systems (QMSs) responsible for their coordination and effective management. This includes meeting local customers' needs, as well as being responsible for global operational effectiveness, aggregate capacity utilization, cost reduction and standardization. This study examines how all of these ends can be accomplished. Regulating local and global needs emerges as a key issue, but one that lacks clarity. Therefore, this article outlines an approach for developing a coherent, strategic approach. Design/methodology/approach A field study of eighteen multinational companies (MNCs) examined and mapped the activity of their QMS, defined representative profiles and compared these profiles to strategic, operational and marketing needs. Findings The data analysis shows several gaps in the approach to global quality management. The lack of coherence and considerable vagueness in addressing inter-organizational processes leads to behavior that fluctuates between absolute autonomy and specific initiatives aimed at reaching the necessary level of integration needed to achieve operational effectiveness. Originality/value The innovative mapping process and analysis of the current study provide a tool for differentiating between the local and global needs of MNCs' quality systems, identifying gaps and defining activities aimed at regulating responses while increasing global added value from the QMS. This provides deeper insight into the business needs of global and local QMSs to enhance the value derived from coordination and regulation.

Therefore, over the years, numerous measuring instruments have been established to quantitatively record a person's connection to nature. However, there is no instrument specifically for children with cognitive limitations. For this reason, in this study, an established scale for connection to nature, the inclusion of nature in self scale (INS), was modified especially for the needs of this group. Study 1 investigated what students understand by the term "nature" in order to create an illustrated version of the INS. In study 2, the new instrument was tested on university students and compared with the original INS and the connectedness to nature scale (CNS). No significant differences between the original INS and the new developed scale were found (p = 0.247), from which it can be concluded that the illustrated INS (IINS) measures the connection to nature with similar accuracy as the original INS. In study 3, the instrument was tested together with other established nature connection instruments on the actual target group, students with disabilities. The correlation between the IINS, the CNS, and nature connectedness scale (NR) were in accordance with the expected literature values (r(IINS-CNS) = 0.570 & r(IINS-NR) = 0.605). The results of this study also prove effectiveness of the developed illustrated scale. This research thus provides a suitable measuring instrument for people with learning difficulties and can make a contribution to the investigation of human-nature connections and conservation education.
